    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>Continuing walking down the long dark tunnel, they walk towards the large hand mark on the wall. Graa approached to look at it and investigated it.</p>
<p>Feeling a creeping sensation in his head and a burning sensation in his eyes he almost loses consciousness as he has a flashback to an image in a book he read a while ago and coming too finds he has the ability to see in the dark more clearly.</p>
<p>Moving around the corner further down, they see a door ahead of them, thick with cobwebs.</p>
<p>Pushing open the door they walk into a room with cobwebs covering the floor causing them to struggle with movement. In the center a statue and floating off the ground 2 Drow warriors. Stepping further in they see 3 giant spiders and attack.</p>
<p>With a mix of darkness being dropped and clever use of spells they easily killed them all.</p>
<p>After the battle they went down a passage way off the room stealthily. Seeing scraping from what looks like giant creatures claws and the now familiar hand paintings.</p>
<p>As they get further down, they hear the words echoing &quot;haha, they send me the cursed one and some play things, poor little baby doesn't like lightening&quot;. Just silence now and the occasional tapping ahead of them.</p>
<p>Peeking out Graa tries to see what might be out there but sees nothing. Hiraani prepares by bringing out his water elemental and they charge in.</p>
<p>Being met with a Undead Drider in front of them, Graa found himself stuck in a giant glass ball, Doge falling in battle and mind games they killed it where it stood.</p>
<p>The Drider whsipered in Hiraani's head about a Woman expecting him. Graa quickly surmises this must be Kiaransee, the Drow demi god behind this and the curse.</p>
<p>Graa notices by one of the fires, a small stone figure wrapped in some white material. Picking it up, Jor looks at it and realises this is a holy symbol of Tarsellis, the god that the residents of Jinlon worship and the material is the same as their robes worn. The one that Jaal uses.</p>
<p>They find the following loot in the cavern</p>
<ul>
<li>Lovers Pottery Wheel</li>
</ul>
