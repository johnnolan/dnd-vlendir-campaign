    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>Read the diary of the fallen enemy</p>
<h2>Bandits Diary</h2>
<p>After reading about it, they took a short rest and healed themselves around a campfire ahead of exploring the passage nearby.</p>
<p>During their rest they took turns reading through a book they found on crafting and gathering to help with their future potion making.</p>
<p>They began searching for the tunnel that lead to the satues in the diary. It took a while but eventually found it and began to descend below.</p>
<p>Upon finding it they went down and found the barrier and began trying to figure out the riddles to put the correct things into the statue bowls that were presented to them.</p>
<p>Left: &quot;Give me food, and I will live. Give me water, and I will die.&quot;</p>
<p>Right: &quot;Thicker than water, I course through you.&quot;.</p>
<p>The riddle of blood Hiraani solved by pricking his finger on his crafting kit needle. At the same time the symbol on the floor glowed a bright light. The second they first tried rashions, then water before finally Graa realising it was fire. He stepped back and let loose a Fire Bolt which instantly lit and caused the barrier to drop.</p>
<p>Making their way in they found 4 more staues surrounding an identitical glowing cirlce. Each read</p>
<p>TL: &quot;Immortality awaits our Lord&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>BL: &quot;He feasts with Chemosh, until his time renewed&quot;</p>
<p>TR: &quot;Immortality awaits our Lord&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>BR: &quot;He feasts with Chemosh, until his time renewed&quot;</p>
<p>Then leaving this they made their way down the western tunnel and found a winding path containing many small vases containing small amounts of gold.</p>
<p>Graa sneakily when the others were exploring, snuck a hand in and pocketed some gold coins. At which point, Hiraani got suspicous and swapped places as they made their way through the cave.</p>
<p>As the path wound round they walked into a chamber with 15 Sarcophogi and the same symbol on the floor. Next to each is placed a Vase 3/4 full of Gold and Gems. 4 Braziers led through the middle glowing a ominous blue colour giving off no heat.</p>
<p>Investigating the spot on the floor, Lorena jumped on the pattern and each time hearing a crash from behind her, eventually all the Sarcophigus burst open to reveal a group of skeleton warriors awakened.</p>
<p>Dispatching this group they made their way East to another chamber with 60ft ceiling held aloft by giant pillars. In the middle of the room was a pedestal with 4 glowing circles around it shining brighter than before.</p>
<p>Upon the pedastal is a book which when read says <strong>The Chosen Immortal</strong>. After picking it up the book disintegrated and a sloppy wet goo dropped onto the floor behind the pedastal forming into a Bodak.</p>
<p>Being caught out in their line of sight and taking some heavy nacrotic damage they dispatched the creature with the other skeletons and proceeded to look in a check behind collecting</p>
<ul>
<li>Oil of Sharpness</li>
<li>Adamantine Half Plate +1</li>
<li>500gp of Diamond Gems</li>
<li>1,000 gp</li>
</ul>
