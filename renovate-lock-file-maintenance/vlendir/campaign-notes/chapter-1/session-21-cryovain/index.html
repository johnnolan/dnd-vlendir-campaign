    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<h3>Dream sequence</h3>
<h4>Hiraani</h4>
<p>You awake in a meadow naked, warm sun and a cool breeze blowing over your skin. Your mind feels at peace as you hear the sound of flying creatures all around you. As your eyesight adjusts, you see all around you a meadow in full summer bloom, natures song all around with the sweet smell of trees and grass filling your sense.</p>
<p>As you look around, you see at one end of the meadow, it drops into a sheer cliff and beyond you see a violent sea, thrashing in deep dark clouds. But its silent. Like its being held back.</p>
<h4>Graa S'oua</h4>
<p>You are sat at the head of a huge dining table inside a beautiful spire hall, the smell of rich food, wine and beer fills your nose as the music and cheer blasts from all around you. As you look to the table you see endless amounts of food and wine. More importantly you see piled in the middle a vast amount of Gold, Platinum and gems. Half naked men and women dance erotically in the essence smoke filled room, laughing and sharing each other. Next to you sits a figure with long red silken robes, a handsome face with long brown curly hair down to his waist and a grin breaking his features. &quot;One day my friend, one day...&quot;</p>
<h4>Lorena Aldabra</h4>
<p>You are soaring in the sky, wind cold and refreshing hits your face as you soar higher with excitement. You look to your left to see if your kin are with you and there they are, your dragon kin with you. You can sense each others feelings, you are all at peace, soaring and free, each of gliding through never ending clouds. Brothers, sisters, friends, parents, all together, all love, all family.</p>
<p>They each get a point of inspiration and Hiraani is not effected by his curse for 24 hours.</p>
<p>As the adventurers awake and stir from their tents, they notice the Anchorite half orc is silent just away from the group, scattered bones in front of him, cross legged and eyes closed in a trance.</p>
<p>As he awakes, he notices them watching him and said &quot;I spoke to my god, he said some will not return today... But we will succeed.&quot;</p>
<p>The adventurers then sat round the small burning camp fire and began filling their stomachs ahead of the fight while they came up with a plan.</p>
<p>As they started talking about the plan, the war chief silently began drawing in the sand a rough layout of the spire. He explained the rooms and where they should move throughout.</p>
<p>Ulla and Pog agreed they are too weak to do a frontal assault on the dragon and will stay away inside the chamber to take shots and run back in.</p>
<p>The Orcs laughed at this and just want to fight, they aren't scared, its a chance for battle and to die for their God. They are ready. No fear, no hesistation.</p>
<p>Hiraani felt attaching a bomb to Doge and sending him in would be a good idea. Doge disagreed. The swiftly moved on to another plan...</p>
<p>As they checked their things, they loaded up to make their way up the mountain to the spire.</p>
<h3>On the way</h3>
<p>As they climbed the path through the mountain it got extermely cold and windy. As they came over the rise with snow in their eyes, they come across an Ogre frozen still in front of them. They discussed whether they should try to thaw it but decided against it and looted a bag it had with 3 healing potions in.</p>
<p>Soon they found themselves at the foot of a 5 foot wide path leading up to the spire. As it loomed over them, they went in single file as quietly as they could predicting that the dragon could hear them at any moment from the top of the spire.</p>
<p>As the group made their way through the front entrance and explored the various areas of the spire, they went through each room noticing the lack of upkeep, crumbling walls, layers of dust and histories left to ruin upon the decorated walls of times past.</p>
<p>The Warchief, as they made their way, looked thoughtful as he remembered his old leader before he was eaten by the dragon who stole their home.</p>
<p>As they made their way to the top of the spire, they entered into what was the orc war chamber with a single door leading onto the roof where they could see the Dragon sleeping.</p>
<h3>The Fight</h3>
<p>As Ulla crept towards the door to take his shot with the Stunzooka, he let his arrow fly but missed as the dragon roared awake, shaking the foundations.</p>
<p>The orcs, Hiraani and Lorena Aldabra all ran out on the attack.</p>
<p>As Graa S'oua, popped out and threw an earth spell knocking the dragon back, Pog threw a frost spell and Lorena Aldabra went in with her blade alight slicing him.</p>
<p>The orcs screaming threw spears and went it for a strike and the Orc Warlord bellowed a war cry giving all who were at first frightened by its presence a new found rage.</p>
<p>The group noticed a band around the dragons neck that gave off a subtle blue glow. Thinking to remove it, Lorena Aldabra jumped onto its back to try and force it off with her sword while the others distracted the dragon. Unfortunately no amount of force would dislodge it and she was thrown from the Dragon.</p>
<p>The final blow was Lorena Aldabra's, as she took her sword and ran through the dragons mouth and through to its underbelly, the whole group fell to the floor to catch their breath.</p>
<p>Looking around they found no loot except the braclet/necklace that sat around its neck.</p>
<p>They took it and then decided to take 3 vials of dragon blood and cut both of the dragon wings off.</p>
<p>Saying their goodbyes to the Gnomes, who said how sorry they were that their weapon was useless in the end, they fetched their horses and loaded the dragon wings on to be carried back to the town.</p>
<p>The Orcs left but not before saying their appreciation of how well the group foungt and agreed to keep hold of one of the sending stones should they need to contact them again. The orc warchief says he will miss them and it was an honor.</p>
<p>As they led their horses to the bottom of the steep mountain pass, they found themselves looking out over the tree canopy stretching for miles. In the distance sounded a low rumbling as the ice wall in the distance began to crumble opening Phandelvin up again once more.</p>
<p>The journey took 3 days on foot to get back to Phandelvin as the skies shone bright during the day, wildlife seemingly returning all around. The nights peaceful as a calm in the air settled on the weary adventurers.</p>
<p>As they made the approach towards Phandelvin, the sun set and night taking over the land, they noticed in the distance a red and orange glow and thick smoke blotting out the stars above.</p>
<p>With screams echoing in the distant air they stood in terror.</p>
