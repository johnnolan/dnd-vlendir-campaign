    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>Riding on, south through the Jorus flats, they ride hard getting distance between themselves and Aldabra.</p>
<p>As the horses start to struggle, they pull up with the other 3 riders and the lead soldier suggests them to rest for a cold camp tonight and begins prepping them for a nights sleep.</p>
<p>As they sat together he asked how they were. Hiraani immediately asked what the hell is going on.</p>
<p>As he pulls out some rations to give to the adventurers, he begins to explain.</p>
<p>His name is Grimbold, his two riding partners, Aron and Theron, a part of the Scarlet Order. They were stationed there as a fall back to help save them on orders of Lorena's Uncle Rab.</p>
<p>Lorena excited by the prospect of seeing her uncle again explained that news of issues in Jorus had reached their ears and they were on their way to see what was happening.</p>
<p>Asking about the twins, Grimbold explained he has spoken to Rab and a mage counciller, Ebras, from her dads court who had escaped. Ebras has true sight allowing him to see through illusions. He noticed 6 months ago, Henfry had turned up and somehow managed to speak to her father and get access to the court.</p>
<p>Her mum was already struggling with the dissapearence of Lorena, spending a lot of time in her room staring out the window. As Monty became more and more enamored by this Henfry, rumours started of them being in a releationship which broke her mum.</p>
<p>Monty became more and more drained over time. Rab turned up to see why taxes were rising, stocks being kept and debts being upaid. As things kept escalating, the populase getting poorer, jobs running out and no food, in came Bryce with this woman who practically walked onto the throne and took control.</p>
<p>Ebras saw all through this and was terrified. He could see who these two new people were. They were a Succubus and a Incubus.</p>
<p>Telling Rab, they made out with Ania and those most loyal south leaving behind only those that could not leave for fear of their family being killed.</p>
<p>He went on to explain that Monty knew about the Scarlet Order and supported them. In order to keep your enemies close and strike deals to ensure no one meant evil to the populace.</p>
<p>The Scarlet Order had worked behind the scenes as this unfolded to help people escape and rescue her mother, she is after all from the common people and they love her.</p>
<p>Her brothers are locked up in the cells below the keep, out of the way and they cannot get them out.</p>
<p>There hope that when the time comes, those that fight for the demons will turn and fight back, but first, they need a plan.</p>
<p>As they finished the conversation, the scarlet order ripped off the badges of house Crawford and attached armour pieces and a helmet all resembling sea shell creatures. Smiling they explained that it will be the best way to distinguish each side on the battle field.</p>
<p>Lorena suggests that is perhaps time for a new banner.</p>
<p>Graa decides to commune by smoking a pipe of shit taking damage while doing so. Unfortunately, The Keeper turns up and mentions how dissapointed he is in him for giving the money they found back to the people of Riverspire.</p>
<p>Hiraani decides to try and commune.</p>
<ul>
<li>Question 1: The Incubus and Succubus you met, are they to do with Varalla? - Yes</li>
<li>Question 2: Can we defeat them with our skills? - Yes</li>
<li>Question 3: Should we bring together the other towns in the Jorus before attacking them? - Unsure</li>
</ul>
<p>Lorena asks to send a message to the Orcs via their Sending Stones.</p>
<p>They ask about whether they know any of the orcs at Radrir. A response of no comes back explaining they are mountain dwelling orcs long split from their tribes. He finished the message with asking how they are.</p>
<p>They ask again, Do they have any tips for killing these orcs... and also Lorena is hot for you xxx</p>
<p>In reply he says, &quot;The orcs down there are just as hard as us, attack first, don't ask questions. We are nice orcs. Tell Lorena&quot;</p>
<p>They decide to get a nights sleep and take some berries offered to help remove the exhaustion they had incurred the previous couple of days.</p>
<p>Awakening the next day they see a stormy cloud in the distance behind them, the feeling of electric in the air and distant rumbles. Hiraani immediately loses control and no one can get him to focus. Grimbold approaches and calmly manages to get Hiraani onto the horse after a tough and calm chat with him. As he pulled his horse next to him, he turned to Graa and indicated that they are being followed behind and they need to speed ahead to the camp.</p>
<p>As the day wore on they leave the chasing army behind.</p>
<p>That night they pull up and Graa being Graa decides to pull a prank on Hiraani by casting a spell that immitates a ligthening strike. As it echos all around them, Hiraani cannot take it and immediately jumps up and runs as far as he can. Seeing this, Grimbold chases after him to ensure he is alright.</p>
<p>Using this, Graa decides to commune. In front of him appears The Keeper with a</p>
<ul>
<li>Question 1: Can I have some of that drink? -No</li>
<li>Question 2: The 2 Demons, are they do do with Varalla? - Yes</li>
<li>Question 3: If we go to the other villages, do we stand a chance of recruiting people from the local towns to help us? - No</li>
</ul>
<p>Frustrated by the questions he asked, he explained to the others what he found out.</p>
<p>Getting some rest for the night, they awake to a fresh morning now the distant storm had past. The heat also picking up as they move further south, becoming more mediteranian in feel. The grass around becoming harder and shorter. Elements of sand start to appear as they look into the distance around them, old crumbled temples overgrown as nature has taken them back.</p>
<p>Pulling up once again for a final nights sleep they ask Grimbold how big the army they have is. Around 3000/4000 strong.</p>
<p>Heading out on their final day, they see in the distance camp fires and flags flying ahead. Grimbold turns to them and says, see you there and they all charge off at full speed towards the camp.</p>
<p>As they pull up in the camp, they tie their horses up and walk towards the center of the camp where they are met with a massive hug and great joy by Lorena's Uncle Rab.</p>
<p>Getting them all ales, they introduce themselves and get settled in.</p>
<p>Lorena asks about her mother and he points her to a lone figure sat on a rock on the outskirts.</p>
<p>As Lorena approached her mum, she called out gently to her.</p>
<p>As she turned around, she saw her face light up and run to give her a hug. As they ended their embrace, Lorena noticed a small turtle in her hands. Asking about it she explained how it had come to her and followed her when the soldiers went to find shells for their armour. Looking around now she could see that all the soldiers had these unqiue sea shells on their armour.</p>
<p>They talked about why she left and her mother talked about how they need to stop with these aweful restrictive laws and go back to their roots. This corruption has been allowed in because they have forgotton who they are. Blushing she joins Lorena in saying they need to &quot;fuck them up&quot; about the Demons.</p>
<p>Lorena, arm in arm, took her mother to see Graa and Hiraani. After some brief introductions and awkward flirting they settle in to talk about what is happening.</p>
<p>Rab asks them about helping with a snake infestation at a local temple. Rumour is that there used to be a tunnel network running under the Jorus that could potentially take them directly under Aldabra. If they can clear out that temple of the snakes and find a teleportation circle with a tunnel going underground then they will know it is true.</p>
<p>If they find this they will take their army and ride to Aldabra. Their plan is not to attack, but feign one, cut out there supply chains and force them to chase them leaving the city bare of guards. This should give the adventurers a better chance of sneaking in and taking the place by surprise.</p>
<p>They agreed to the plan and decided to have food and drinks while catching up and passing out for the night.</p>
<p>As they awake in the morning before heading off, Hiraani tries to commune.</p>
<ul>
<li>Question 1: Are the succubus and incubus bonded to a partner - Unsure</li>
<li>Question 2: Have they spawned - Yes</li>
<li>Question 3: Can we befriend the snake people - No</li>
</ul>
<p>Graa chose to commune too</p>
<ul>
<li>Question 1: Has he bonded with Lorenas mum? - No</li>
<li>Question 2: Has he bonded with the wizard? - No</li>
<li>Question 3: Has he bonded with the snakes? - No</li>
</ul>
<p>Lorena decided to also commune to find some answers to the turtle</p>
<ul>
<li>Question 1: Do we have a spy in the camp? - No</li>
<li>Question 2: Is there anything magical about this turtle? - Yes</li>
<li>Question 3: Is this turtle some kind of descendent of the ancient god of the Jorus? - Yes</li>
</ul>
