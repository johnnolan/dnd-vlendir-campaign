Most beautiful of the Fey, given over to her own impulsive desires, Aislaine roams the Feywild, from Morningtide to Everbright, to Twilight and into the Everdark. She is fearless and heedless of any dangers. Although Aislaine has little interest in the other Fey Elders or other Fey of the Feywild, she has a keen interest in the worlds beyond the Feywild and the beings that live there.

Aislaine sees beings of the material worlds as flawed and imperfect, which, to Aislaine, is a most wondrous thing. Aislaineâ€™s fascination with the other planes leads her to seek out the places where gateways open up between the planes and venture forth into the unknown lands beyond.

For those mortals who come across Aislaine in the woods, either in the Feywild or on their own plane, the experience can prove deadly. Stories abound of hunters and trappers who, after catching a glimpse of Aislaine in the woods, disappear into the forest.

Faen, the Dreadwolf is her protector, a giant wolf in its form, he is the essence of all living creatures. Glorious in its size and beauty it is both a fierce enemy and proud. Loving in its nature and protection of all things living.
