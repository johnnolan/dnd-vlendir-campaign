## General Summary

As the adventurers approached the outskirts of the Shrine of Savras, they spotted an Orc in one of the towers keeping watch. Hiraani after 3 attempts, finally hit home with an arrow to the orc. Once hit it screeched and ran out of sight.  

 Immediately the group ran forward to silence this orc, however getting closer, realised that it wasn't just that orc who was in this template.  

 As wave after wave of Orc attacked, they chopped heads off, threw bombs and burnt their enemies with magic. However, all the noise just caused more Orcs to attack until when only 2 were left standing, around the corner came running 3 Ogres with anger burning in their eyes as they spied the carnage of their allies around them.
