## General Summary

Adventures started with a nightmare/vision envolving a stormy sea and being slammed everywhere. Almost drowning before a darkness and stillness overtook them and the sound of heavy wings around around them, before a voice echoed mockingly, "Just mortals, weak".  

 They all awoke, not knowing each other in a new town in front of a shrine which turned out to be a Shrine of Luck.  

 Went and asked questions of the barman who they scared at first and found no answers before bullying an old drunk who had no idea who or what they wanted.  

 Giving up they decided to pick a quest from the quest board to see if they could find more information.  

 Touching the shrine for good luck on their way to the Dwarven Excavation they made their way there.  

 Upon reaching there they met 2 dwarves and agreed for the offer of 2 [Sending Stones](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/sending-stones) they would explore the cavern ahead.  

 They engaged in their first fight with an [Ochre Jelly](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ochre-jelly) with Lorena Aldabra taking a lot of damage.
