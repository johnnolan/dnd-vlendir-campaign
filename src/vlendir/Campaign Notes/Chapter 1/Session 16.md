## General Summary

As the adventurers awoke and made their way down to breakfast, they were greeting by a fine spread of meats and breads to build that energy back up for the day.  

 While say down, Falcon told them about the history of the Dragon Barrow that he had learnt from books in his library.  

> Lady Tanamere Alagondar was a royal scion of Neverwinter more than a century ago. Along with two parties of adventurers, she fought and killed Azdraka, a green dragon that had long terrorized the High Road. Lady Alagondar died in the battle and was laid to rest beneath a barrow near where the dragon fell. The remains of her fallen compatriots and the corpse of Azdraka were sealed in the barrow with her, in accordance with Lady Alagondar’s dying wishes.

 He spoke of the invisible forces and what sounded like Willo Wisps that exist around that area. How the tomb will be black and they should ensure they have some sort of spell to see invisible beings or be able to disable/paralyze their foes in order to more easily beat them.  

 He gave the 2 Greater Healing Potions for their journey ahead before asking to speak with Hiraani in private.  

> I saw you fighting yesterday, a fellow Ranger. Those swords are leathal!  
>
> I also saw those markings on your arms. That is very special my friend, do not forget who bestows these powers that I can sense on you. I have heard of Chislev before, she must see something in you, to protect nature.  
>
> Will you accept some advice from a veteran who has seen his share of battle?  
>
> Be sure to use all your powers to your advantage. If Lorena is getting up close, stop them moving, confuse and charm them, use nature to criple them, tame nature, heal.  
>
> You are one of the most powerful rangers I have ever met, you are going to be a legend if you survive this.  
>
> I want to give you a gift in case you find yourself out of the battle in close, here take these, this will help you hit true and support your friends. There is something special about you all, look after each other, you each need to keep each other alive. Also I wouldn't mind seeing Lorena alive next time we meet.

 As Hiraani opened up about his past and his hate for Gods, Falcon encouraged him to embrace the God who was trying to help and that he was envious of his gifts at such an age.  

 Upon returning ot hte group, the adventurers made their way towards the barrow and while on the journey found a deposit of chalk and clay. They scooped 2 bags up in the hope throwing this would unvail their enemy.  

 Upon arriving they were met by Xanth, a hulking great Centaur who had an over the top positivity about him. Informing them of his home being overtaken by orcs, forcing him to find a new home in this area, he proceeded to show them the entrance to the barrow and warn of the Willow Wisps he sees out at night.  

 Making their way down into the tombs, the adventurers were met with 3 Willo Wisps. As they attacked they found the little energy balls incredibly hard to hit but in the end with a little help from Doge, they managed to destroy all of them.  

 Begining to explore the first part of the tomb, they identified a trap in the floor and jumped over the danger to see 4 graves and a decision on whether to plunder or not.
