## General Summary

Went on to explore the rest of the house  

 After killing the remaining orcs and Graa S'oua sustaining some heavy damage, they settled in for some ale, meats, bread and butter and feasted until sleep getting a long rest.  

 Each party member was given a [Big Al's Glass Skull of Drinking]( https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2924061-big-als-glass-skull) by Big Al (Alfonse Kalazorn)  

 Woke to breakfast set out with Big Al nowhere in sight. Ate quickly and grabbed some **pocket bacon** for the road ahead.  

 Found Big Al loading the bodies in a cart and joined him in the cart to make their way back.  

 Camped one night on the way back, Graa S'oua hunted a rabbit, skinned it (sort of) and boiled it up to eat in his cauldron.  

 While having the shits behind his tent, Hiraani managed to stealthily shit with a nat 20 into his cauldron, all smells and shapes of poo went into it.  

 **Upon returning to Phandelver**  

 They said goodbye to Big Al and handed in the quest to Harbin Wester.  

 Buying armour and provisions they prepared to make their way to Mountain Toe Gold Mine  

 Before they could leave, Graa S'oua had a vision standing absolutely still and struck a deal with [The Keeper](/w/vlendir-drusslegend/a/the-keeper-person) , god of greed and death to forgoe his Paladin ways and gain new powers. He agreed.
