## General Summary

As the adventurers made their way through the rest of the cave system, they finally stumbled upon a group of miners starved near to death. As they helped give them some rations and water, they left them to rest where Don Jon stayed to help settle them down to sleep.  

 As they made their way through another tunnel out the back of this cavern, they found a secret exit leading them out the opposite side of the cave system.  

 Upon exploring the area they found a freshly dug grave site. Before they stepped any further [Hiraani](/w/vlendir-drusslegend/a/hiraani-the-eyemaster-person) heard crunching and snorting further past the graves in a bush. They all made their way to the center of the grave site to get a better view and began arguing about whether to attack whatever it is.  

 At this point Don Jon came out and upon recognising the sound of a Troll eating bones, he noped back into the cave where the group followed to rest up for the night and see if they could attempt an attack after a rest.  

 In the morning, Hiraani had an idea to arm the miners with crossbows from the dead wererats and all of them go out and attack this creature.  

 As they marched out into the field and took a line formation with Don Jon arranging the firing order, the other 3 adventurers ran out into battle with the Troll.  

 After multiple arrow storms and some clever fighting, the Troll was overcome and fell to them.  

 After the battle the head of the miners mentioned that the wererats had come from the Shrine of Savras where Orcs had kicked them from their home and spoke of a golden treasure that lies there.  

 Worried that the Orcs may attack, the adventurers agreed to go ahead and visit the Shrine of Savras to irradicate the Orc incursion, arriving just after midday.
