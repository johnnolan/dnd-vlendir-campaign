## General Summary

### Woodland Manse

The adventurers, after recovering from their fearce battle, levelled up and began an exploiration of the rest of the manse.  

 Looking into the well that contained the vine creatures, ready to burn whatever was in there, they discover no more dangers and make their way around the house.  

 They find one room which looked to be home to some sort of ritual circle where they found a Staff of Thunder and Lightning and 4 Greater Healing Potions. Studying the circle it appeared to be 3 lightening bolts converging into the middle. Graa S'oua recognised this symbl to be Talos, the evil god of storms.  

 Moving on from here they went through other rooms to discover a hole in the roof where Lorena Aldabra helped both Graa S'oua and Hiraani up and the continued to look through the bottom floor finding nothing of worth.  

 While Lorena Aldabra was busy downstairs, Hiraani and Graa S'oua both found a secret room hidden behind an old wardrobe. Looking into the room they found a small ornamental box which when opened contained a Amulet of Health and 1,236 gp.  

 After a bit of arguing, the boys came to a great growth moment where Hiraani allowed Graa S'oua to keep the Amulet for the greater good of the group.  

 As Lorena Aldabra joined them, they made their way through the rest of the house finding no other information and made their way out the front entrance.  

 As they reached the front door, Hiraani spotted 3 Anchorite of Talos standing outside waiting for them to exit. As he stealthed his way outdoors to take a closer look he surmised that they were not looking to attack and the one in the middle being held up was the one they just killed.  

 Hiraani made a decision to offer to talk and form a truce. After an intense back and forth of miss speech, violent truths and bad outbursts by Graa S'oua, the adventurers managed to come to terms to get them to stop attacking and move out of the area but away from the dragon and meet them when ready at the foot of Icespire Peak for the attack on the Dragon.  

 As a final favour in return, they asked the adventurers to make their way to the Circle of Thunder to stop a summoning of their minor thunder god, Gorthok the Thunder Boar. Giving one of the seeing stones to them they made their way to spread word to their clan.  

### Circle of Thunder

Upon approaching the Circle of Thunder, they noticed storm clouds and distant thunder coming from the location they headed. As they arrived, they took cover in some trees just outside the circle and noticed the center of the storm focussed in the center of the circle. As they spotted two Anchorite of Talos dancing in the middle in some sort of ritual, the lightening got more violent, crashing all around them. Hiraani broke down in panic and led on the floor muttering under his breath.  

 Panicking on what to do, Lorena Aldabra placed her cloak over him while they tried to figure out how to stop this.  

 Suddenly with a final clash of lightening the clouds dissapeared in an instant and the creatures in the circle fell to the floor in exhaustion.  

 As the storm dissapered, Hiraani jumped up into action, Graa S'oua then sent a tidal wave stright through the pair of them knocking them to the ground in a sneak attack. With that, Lorena Aldabra and Hiraani jumped into the fray to slice them dead while they lay knocked down.  

 At that moment, they heard a smashing and a giant roar as the newly summoned Gorthok, charged in firing lightening at them and striking hard at Hiraani. Misty stepping away to heal, he came back into the fray and with a round of harsh strikes and a well placed lightening bolt, Hiraani took the final swipe to end the creatures life.
