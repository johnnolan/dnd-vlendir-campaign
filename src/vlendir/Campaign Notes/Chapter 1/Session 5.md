## General Summary

Adventurers took the Gnomeragarde quest and made their way there.  

 Upon exploiring the place and meeting a range of crazy gnomes who wanted to test their arrow contraptions on them and others who were distracted by work, they helped kill a [Mimic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mimic) and convince the kings that everything was safe.  

 They were rewarded for their efforts and asked about using the Arrow machine in Phandelver. The gnomes said they would do what they could.  

 Upon returning home, the Barkeep hearing of their deeds has given them rooms for free for 5 nights as a way to say thank you for helping the town.  

 They ended the night ordering bread and wine they heard about and saw stored in Gnomeragarde and slept.
