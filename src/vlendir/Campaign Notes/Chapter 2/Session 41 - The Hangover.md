## General Summary

As Crispin welcomes them all and says "Hi Son, how are you" to Graa, they begin to discuss recent events.  

 Ania mentions to Monty how nice a person Graa is and that he offered her some perfume when they last met as a gift to which Monty raised a curious eye brow towards him. She also mentions how Crispin is a regular visitor, usually more for council.  

 Ania stands and welcomes them all to the table thanking them again for everything they went through. Sitting down, Lorena tries to give Ifen a quick wedgy but the years of abuse have made him sharp and he catches her hand quickly shaking his head, smiling.  

 Monty went round thanking each individually and hinting towards change being needed in Aldabra.  

 Crispin begins by asking about their journies since since Phandelver and they relaid back all the information. After he mentioned that he made his way back with the choker to medeis island. The choker when broken down appeared to have enchantment magic not made on this plane. It came from the Shadowfell and also had essences of Fey magic. This makes no sense as the realms are split and should not be able to interact with each other.  

 They spoke of Saskia in the Riverspire of the Feywild who he doesn't know. He explains there is more good in the Feywild than in the Shadowfell but its still a land of extremes and any interaction they should be careful. Everything is out to trick you or kill you. They spoke of her being a half fey and they generally have more of this plane in their mindset and are safer.  

 He spoke about going into Graa's head and appologised, but felt they needed the help with something so massive. Lorena at that point threw a bag across the table containing the crystal shards. They explained they found them after the portal closed and when Hiraani touched them he was taken somewhere else. Didn't seem to happen to anyone else.  

 With concern on his face he emptied the bag on the table and spoke more to dig into what happened. Turning to Monty, he asks if he wants to explain a little more on what this is.  

 Monty tells them it was 1 piece and has been a secret locked away under the keep for thousands of years since the rebalancing. He doesn't know what they do but its been kept secret and safe, their true purpose has been forgotton.  

 Crispin chimes in to expand further. There are different types of shards that would allow powers to work across planes, harness the powers of the other realms and even move between the two. This one is of the Shadowfell and can be only used by people who have a part of the Shadowfell in them or are completely of that plane. There are Feywild Shards and Astral Shards as well. They are very rare.  

 He tells Hiraani that he will look into it further as to why this may be happening. It could have been power left over from their use or something else. He says he will take one of them with him and give the other 2 shard parts to Monty to keep under guard.  

 Monty tells them they have free rein of the library should they wish to use it. Hiraani asks about would the Elves know anything about this? He encourages him to go give it a try if he thinks so.  

 Lorena breaks it to her mum Ania that they have seen Dragons mother, a dragon turtle and told them the story of Tu'Sin. In shock, Monty asks if everyone would be willing to visit there and pay their respects tomorrow.  

 A servant entered and put 2 boes in front of them. Monty placed 2 of the shards in one and Crispin put one in another. Putting a amber neckalce on the table and placing hands on both, the box dissapears into the amber and he attaches back around his neck.  

 They also then pass the cursed coin to Crispin who identifies it as coming from the Feywild and hand it back. Once again warning them to be careful of creatures there.  

 Excusing himself, he says he will be around for a few days, be sure to visit him before they head off anywhere.  

 Monty then offers them a reward for each of them. 10,000gp for their journey ahead and to be prepared for what comes next.  

 Finishing up conversations they parted ways and headed out for the day.  

  

### Thieves Guild

 

  

 Making there way over to the thieves guild, they managed to find the entrance talked about and after a short introduction with 2 characters, managed to get led back to The Serpent and access a downstairs cellar behind a fake wall.  

 Walking into the Theives Guild, the entire place is like an underground market place. Different areas had different areas available for certain goods. Approaching the corner that had tradesman there, they go and purchase items inbetween the bussel of others preparing for a day of theiving.  

 Hiraani bought the Sovereign Glue Lorena bought the Immovable Rod Graa bought a Cloak of Billowing  

 Upon leaving, the group noticed a group fo people huddled around a notice board with lots of blueprints and maps of different areas of Aldabra. Trying to get closer, a huge Goliath with a massive sword came in front to block their movement. After some awkward and dumb conversation they gave up and moved towards the entrance. Looking back they could see a woman, wearing a pirate style hat and tunic with long wavy brown hair look up and give a smile and shake of the head as she watched them leave.  

### Tattoos

 

 Hiraani and Lorena each got a tattoo. Hiraani got a Shadowfell Tattoo, a broken shard at the bottom of his neck and Lorena got a Ghost Step Tattoo. A back piece with a massive moon, shining, on a forest with a shadow of a person and no body in the forest.  

  

### Shopping

 

#### Magic Shop

 

 Hiraani bought Cloak of the Manta Ray (collect the next day) Lorena bought Cloak of the Manta Ray (collect the next day) and a ring of cold resistance (collect the next day) Graa bought a Cap of Water Breathing  

### Library

 

 Graa and Hiraani made their way into the Library while Lorena had her tattoo. Finding Crispin in a side room, Graa and Hiraani go in to say hello.  

 Crispin said he is leaving in the next day or 2 and asks if they will come with him to Medeis. He thinks the 3 of them are important to these events and wants them to explore the possibility of something being on that ship that Hiraani tried to save and was the last thing to happen before these events. He asks if they would be willing to see what that ship contains. Any time he enquires about the ship from his contacts, they go cold and say they know nothing. He needs a group powerful enough to exploire and check that nothing is awry with it. That area is also on the continent and close to where Hiraani was raised, so maybe they can look into Hiraani's history, the shards and also this at the same time?  

 They both agree and he asks to have some time with Graa.  

 He appologised again to Graa for spying on him and sending a message but he was worried ever since he thought he had lost him from before. He goes on to say how proud of him he is, how he has grown and managed to deal with this entity, The Keeper.  

 Turning to the side, he lifts up a large object wrpapped in cloth and tells Graa that if he had completed his training he would have been given one of these, however he has proved beyond a doubt he is capable of having one. He hands Graa a Staff of Power.  

 Back in the Library, Hiraani searched for Shards and the Rebalancing. About the Shards, he finds out that these were common for the first couple of hundred years after the Rebalancing. Creatures would use them to go back and forth and use power from the planes in this one. Each time they were defeated the shards were destroyed or hidden from use. He also found a small snippet of a reference to their being a use of the different shards just before the Rebalancing but that is it.  

 Graa searched for information on sea monsters and now had the ability to know the strengths and weaknessess of common sea creatures in Vlendir.  

  

  

 As they finished their shopping, they made their way back to Lorena's room to sleep for the night. Not before a little trip to the Ocean Breeze.  

 Hiraani walked up to the lady at the front and asked about a bath house. Then moving back and casting pass without a trace, he sneaks in the front door and makes his way into the bath house. Getting into one of the tubs he bathed well and then left a water otter in the tub as he got out. Drying up and dressed he screamed what is that! and walks out as people inside start causing a scene and begin to get dressed and complain. The woman outside immediately makes her way in.  

 Meanwhile, Graa casts burning hands to light 2 bundles of hay on fire and roll them towards the entrance. Then using his cloak of billowing, stood inbetween arms out wide and announced loudly "I have come for your women!"  

 Running outside with the otter on the end of a stick, the woman stopped in shock trying to take in what the hell is happening.  

 Laughing to themselves, they made their way back to get a good nights sleep.
