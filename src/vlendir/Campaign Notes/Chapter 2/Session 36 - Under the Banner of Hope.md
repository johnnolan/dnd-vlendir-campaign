## General Summary

Turning to the water fountain in the corner, they went to look at it. Looking around they saw on the inside of the fountain a bunch of coins sitting at the bottom. Lorena suggested throwing in a silver piece and the others joined in too.  

 Exploring more of the area, they searched for any sort of lever or switch around including a solid sarcophocus.  

 Giving up, they looked at the writing above the door. As Lorena read the Dwarvish writing, she read out loud  

> I stay the same size no matter how much I weigh

 

 After guessing a vast amount of words, the group finally shouted "Scales". With that the door way opened to them presenting a steep drop down into another chamber below.  

 Once again, Doge lead the way going down and after a few minutes came to indicate that all is clear.  

 As they got to the new room, there in the middle stood a transportation circle glowing and ahead of them another doorway with writing in Dwarvish again above.  

 As Graa spent a minute studying the symbol on the floor to memorise it, Lorena went and read out the wording above the door.  

> Undergove Trade Route, Section 1

As Graa came too, he had memorised the circle. They looked at each other and decided to take a long rest to recover before going any further.  

 As the next morning comes, they approached the stair way ahead and went down. 100ft it went down before eventually opening up to a long tunnel stretching ahead of them, 30ft high and 40 foot wide, along the side and roof of the wall a thin strip of glowing light blue runes lit up the way ahead.  

 As they walk into the tunnel, they get a feeling of magic and excitement. As Hiraani takes a few steps forward, he stops and looks back to notice he has moved 30 feet ahead of them. They quickly realised the magic here gives the traveller a magical way of moving faster.  

 As they regroup, they decide to make their way back out of the temple and to the Jorus campsite to report on what they had found.  

 As the enter the camp, they see all the camp packing up and prepping ahead of leaving. As they look across they see Ebras, Ania, Rab, 2 captains 1 male, 1 female and 2 scarlet order are all huddled around a table with a map of the Jorus. They all ask about the temple and is there a tunnel that goes underground?  

 After explaining what they saw, the plan is set. Rab asks if they are ready to go tomorrow morning to which they agree.  

 At that point, Hiraani explains that Graa could do with some healing tonight, maybe share a bed. Ania offers to find someone who can help. Graa says he really wants to "Royal Jelly" to which she was a bit confused but admitted if its royal it must be good and she will try and find some for him.  

 Ania looks to Rab and says it is time. Taking a large piece of material to the side of them, she makes her way to the center of the camp as Rab steps up and smashes a bell with his Warhammer to signal everyone to group in the camp.  

 As Ania steps onto a rock, she unfurls a new flag, Bronze coloured with black and white trim outining a dragon turtle with 3 lines like a sun rise coming from the top and a hammer under the turtle.  

 She adresses everyone  

> Together we will stand against this great evil. Together we will move forward, no longer stuck in a spiral of greed and mistrust. Gold runs through every decision of those most powerful and we have lost our way. Who we are! This is a new day, a new age for us all. We will harry them, confuse them, turn them to our cause. Let us rescue our loved ones from this tyranny and start anew, like we used to live. My daughter and her friends have come to us, powerful and righteous they will help us redefine the strength of The Jorus! Now go, our fastest riders, take our flag and this message to all lands in the Jorus. We attack in 6 days, be swift, we are taking back our home!

 

 As the crowd cheered aloud, everyone immediately dispersed and grabbed their kit ahead of their ride. A group of riders ran to the tent to get smaller versions of the flags and scrolls before mounting their horses with a spare one for swapping on the fast journies they will need to do to spread the word.  

 As they returned to the tent, Lorena sees walking towards her, Mali Crawford, Bryce's sister, with a baby in her arms. She explains to Lorena that she is now married to her brother, Elis and they are in love. She isn't like her family, she hates them and Bryce most of all. She is here to protect her new born daughter, before offering Brie to Lorena saying she is now an Aunty. Lorena emotional takes Brie in her arms and accepts Mali in with her.  

 She goes on to explain that Elis has take those loyal in Duskmoor and Autmnrun and made his way south a couple of days ride from here to join with this camp in a few days. They aim to take back the Jorus. After he heard of your exploits with the dragon and that you have been captured and escaped here, he decided the time is now.  

 As the camp was setting up for the rest of the night before the final push the next day, they all shared in drinks and settled in for the night.  

 The next morning before heading off, Ebras approached them and gave them a Wand of Pyrotechniques. He told them to fire it high over Aldabra once they have taken the keep. This will be the signal to let everyone know to stop fighting and that the demon pressence is gone.  

 He also gave them a sand timer that indicates a day has passed which will be essential when travelling underground.  

 Visiting the merchant one more time and speaking to Rab, they got hold of 6 nets ready for the battle ahead.  

 Finding Ania, they approached her to ask about the turtle. Asking if they could commune with the turtle, she agreed and handed over Dragon to Hiraani.  

 Holding the turtle as a commune focus, he found himself drift away. Looking down, he doesn't see the same aura as Lorena explained of seeing last time.  

*   Question 1: Can this turtle communicate with the Feywild - No
*   Question 2: Does this turtle come from the Feywild - No
*   Question 3: Does this turtle have a connection with Dragons? - Yes

 

 Handing Dragon over to Lorena, she decides to use her armour ability to detect dragons within the area.  

 As she looks down, she feels an element of Dragon kin from the turtle. Deciding to commune for more answers, she attempts to find more answers, but once again fails.  

 Handing Dragon back to her mum, she left to try and think on things learnt.  

 Ask the group laid down for this final nights sleep, they awoke to see the campsite now nearly completely packed up. Saying their goodbyes to everyone and making final preperations, Lorena once more asked for Dragon. As she held him close, she noticed the runes on her armour glow slightly when holding him.  

 She attempted to commune once more and this time succeeded, feeling a strong connection with Dragon and appearing in the Fey dream with Dragon their too.

*   Question 1: Did you send this to aid us? - No
*   Question 2: Can we accelerate his growth? - No
*   Question 3: Is this turquoise aura able to protect us? - No

Coming to, she looks down and sees Dragon just staring at her blankly.  

 Saying good bye to her mum, the group turned and went to go.  

 Wanting to leave in fashion, Lorena for the first time bampfed her wings out, took hold of Graa and Hiraani in a papoose and launched into the air.  

 As they flew towards the temple, looking behind they saw the Dwarf merchant for a final time, look up in shock and fall back off the cart looking at them fly away.  

 As the hour goes by, Lorena lands safely 400 yards out and her wings retract. Walking the rest of the way, windswept, they step down into the temple once more, through the different chambers and approach the steps down from the summoning circle.
