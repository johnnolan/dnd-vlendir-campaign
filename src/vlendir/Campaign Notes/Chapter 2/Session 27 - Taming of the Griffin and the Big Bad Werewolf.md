## General Summary

As the group awoke the next morning, they discussed the idea of trying to tame the Griffin to aid them in their attack.  

 As they talked, the group noticed a note on the table  

>  
> 
>  "I can do it Graa, I will spread the rumour for you, I promise. You kill that twat! (Sorry for the language Saskia)".

 

  

 Harry had decided to try and help them by going to the town during the night.  

 Saskia agreed to transport them to the location of the Griffin as long as she wasn't involved in any hurt to it and they set off.  

 Lorena decided to try and reach out to see if she can feel any presence of a dragon in the area. Unfortunately she found no sign of one, the feeling a lone and sad feeling.  

 Saskia agreed to meet them outside of town once they had finished and took them out to a giant tree for them to lead their horses to and transport them out.  

 Appearing out the side of another tree, they proceeded to the Griffins nest.  

 As they snuck up, Hiraani immediately ran towards the Griffin as it screeched loudly, ready to attack. Casting animal friendship and holding out pocket bacon, the Griffin stops screeching, tilts its head and takes the food from him. Then settles next to him awaiting a command.  

 His name thereforth was Bod.  

 Bod stretched its wings out and shoots up into the air and circling high keeping an eye over the half a days journey. They made their way towards the cave.  

 Upon reaching the cave entrance, they snuck up slowly to the entrance. Noticing the ground littered with hound foot prints, they silvered and threw 3 caltrops in the cave prolapsed mouth.  

 Once set, Graa used Thermaturgy to create a sound 2 people moving by.  

 At that point, 2 Hell Hounds darted out of the prolapse and attacked. Suddenly behind them, 2 more appeared. After a short battle with the Caltrops helping and the final strike taking down the last Hell Hound a wolfs frustrated and screetching howl echoes out of the cave followed by a childs scream shouting "Graa!" at the top of its voice before going silent.  

 After a quick chat, they decided to use Polymorph to shrink the Grffin so it could fit and ran into the prolapse.  

 As they ran through the prolapse they ran into a main chamber surrounded by bright sconces, a giant fire int he middle burning and a cage with an unconcious Harry in. Through the flames stared two giant red eyes as Ivan in his Werewolf form stared at them with a giant axe in his hands.  

 As the battle progressed, the group, Doge and the Griffin all attacked. Hiraani misty stepped over to Harry, freed him and brought him back with a healing potion. Then with a combination of trickery, doging lightening spells and a range of slashing attacks, they slaughtered the werewolf with a final blow of dual rapiers taking the werewolves eyes.  

 They watched as the top half of the body turned back human and the bottom remained the same.
