## General Summary

As the adventurers awoke from a nights sleep, Lorena went to find her mum. Expalining to her mum about the Feykin she is blessed with and the news that Dragon could be special.  

 Returning to the group, they discuss whether to go to the beach to see if they can find the source of where the turtle came from. They decided to commune to find out whether that path is worth while.  

 Approaching her mum, she tried to commune with her, showing her what she can do. As they both sat down while holding Dragon, they closed their eyes and focussed. As Lorena felt herself drift, she looked down to Dragon to see him glowing. The shock broke her concentration and couldn't make contact. Upset, Lorena appologised to her mum and went back to the group.  

 Hiraani stepped forward and tried to commune instead.  

* Question 1: Is this turtle significant to this quest - indifferent
* Question 2: If we went to the beach, would it reveal more about the turtle - No
* Question 3: Would we find more turtles? - No

As they preparred to leave, they asked for anyone who may be able to help. He said no as they needed everyone and they had no one as strong as they were.  

 They went to a merchant and bought a range of items including bombs, arrows and kits for lockpicking.  

 Loading up they made their way for the 3 hour ride to the temple.  

 As they approached the temple from a distance, they saw moving figures sliding around the temple. They decided to sneak their way up to them and lure them out.  

 Graa being able to listen in could understand what they said. Currently just grunting and bored, they patrolled around the temple. He used this to his advantage and caused a sound outside to get them all to come and look at what was happening.  

 The plan worked and as they all piled outside, Hiraani threw up a wind wall and the battle commenced.  

 An easy fight in all, they sliced and set fire to the things before dealing the final blow to end the battle.  

 Looking through the loot they found a Belt of the Serpant that Hiraani claimed and gave his strength belt to Lorena. Among the other loot they find a ball bearing which when dropped appears to return back to the owner. Suited up they saw a set of stairs leading down and approached it ready to go underground.
