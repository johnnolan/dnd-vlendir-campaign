## General Summary

As they set sail on their first journey on a ship together, the sun set in the distance and the crew set about their duties for the night journey lighting lanterns.  

 On the first watch of the night, Lorena looking down into the darkness noticed a movement in the water, almost a trick of the eye and asked one of the deck hands to keep a closer watch out.  

 At the second watch of the night all seemed calm until they heard a voice grunt at the front of the ship followed by a large splash. As the crew members ran to the front they shouted that Dave had fallen into the water. The ship slammed to a halt as they dropped anchor and the sails dropped to allow them to get him out of the water.  

 At that point they saw a group of fish folk appear at the front of the ship and a battle commenced.  

 The fish folk threw nets and cast spells causing all sorts of issues for the fighters as the captain tried to steady the ship and rescue his crewmen.  

 As they kept slashing at these creatures, 3 more appeared behind them. Captain Lee saw this issue, raised the sails and with a jolt, spun the ship as hard as he could to knock them off balance. One fell into the water while 2 remained helping the group out.  

 As they fought their way out of the nets and cut down the powerful magic user, they sunk down to catch a breath and heal up a very wounded Graa.  

 The captain had never been attacked on this lake, it had always been peaceful and had no idea how this could happen. They agreed to make their way for the final hour to their new home and rest once they were on shore.  

 As the dropped anchor, the group got in a row boat and made their way to the dock outside a beautiful and old wooden cabin that sat beside the lake.  

 Looking inside they saw a seating area in front of a fire, a bar area empty except one bottle and a eating area. 4 bedrooms awaited them.  

 As they looked around, below one of the bear skin rugs, Lorena saw a trap door that had a rusted hinge. Placing her sword in the gap to use a leverage, she bust it open and alerted the others.  

 They went down to see a vast 20ft high chamber with a passage way to the side. Following the passage, it entered into a sort of workshop lit by some sort of eternal magical light.  

 At the bottom of the passage a room with 2 beds could be seen with a skeletal corpse lying there. Around the corner stood 4 pillars, each with a symbol on, a bear, dragon, whale and a wolf. In the middle of these was a complex clockwork cage built into the floor with a well trodden path from the bed to the cage itself. On the shelf behind them they see 4 glowing gems, brown, red, blue and grey.  

 Solving the puzzle by putting each colour gem on each pillar at the same time, the cage in the middle unlocked in a complex spinning like a clock before finally stopping still. As it stopped, a sound from the main chamber they descended into come from behind.  

 Going to investigate, they see a giant arcana symbol moving on the floor. Graa recognises this immediately as a Teleportation Circle that he can use to return them here should they need it.  

 Wondering about the reasons why there was a skeleton there, they go to investigate and find a note by the skeleton.  

> 12 years, 12 years it has taken me, but it is finally complete. A way for me to return once I rescue my love. She will be waiting still? Of course she will, how would she not be waiting, she loves me. 12 years is no time to wait in prison for me. I have spent 12 years underground building us a way out once I reach her.  
>
> I just need to touch her. Once I do we will return here.  
>
> I must protect the circle while I am gone. I cannot risk it being found... I have an idea... I will be with you soon, my love.
