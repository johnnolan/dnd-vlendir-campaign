## General Summary

Turning to Lorena, Monty asks her not to kill him. Giving him her trident to lean on, they walked over to a set of chairs so he could sit and rest.  

 He indicated her brothers were also locked up in the cells and they rushed to unlock the cells and replace them with Fontaine.  

 After some sibling banter back and forth about how Lorena now appears to have friends and how she had saved them from the cells, they settled around to plan what to do next.  

 Ifan, after being released from his manicles, took a deep breath, grabbing a symbol around his neck and appeared to use magic to heal himself. Asking to keep this magic skill away from his Dad, as Hiraani suggested he use Fontaines armour in case he needs it.  

 At that point the group heard a massive rubble that shook the walls around them loosening dust on the walls. They turned to run and free Lui and all run back to the main chamber.  

 As they all collect there, in the final moments of Graa's Detect Magic spell, he notices a small football sized orb floating in the air next to him. As he stared at it, it vanishes as the spell wears off.  

 Filling her father in on Raab and the rebellion army, he spoke how Amilie was working on something and she never managed to control him. It turned out Bryce had also not been mind controlled, but had willingly done all this evil himself to gain power.  

 Ifan stood and decided to go with them taking a great sword and shield then going to get the armour of fontaines.  

 Making their way around towards the entrance for the battle, they opened the hatch and sent Doge out first. Counting down for a short time they then snuck in and hid as well as they could all coming out into the main chamber.  

 In front of them they saw Amelie, sobbing in a chair with a half human (with the face of Bryce), half demon, teenage looking creature, feeding from her teets also in tears comforting. In the back corner next to her, they saw a large black portal in the ground. Bryce was also there, looking terrified in the other corner.  

 Amelie looking up, screams at them ordering her child to destroy them. As they all preparred to fight, out of the portal came a giant Zombie Clot, its entire body made up of the dead as it rose from the portal and joined the attack.  

 As the battle started, the group ran in to destroy first the zombie clot while trying to avoid the Cambion creature that flew around firing fire at them all from distance. Bryce ran to try and get away but was caught all the way by the fey creature.  

 As Graa came to take his first hit, a wild magic surge kicked in and he found himself turned into a flower pot, hitting the ground. Just before he did, he heard a voice in his head giving him advice on what to do.  

 As he snapped out of his plant pot form, he immediately cast dispel magic twice, each time causing the portal to shrink and finally close as he saw within the outstretched arms of more creatures trying to come forth.  

 As the group killed the Cambion finally, Amelie screamed in absolute anger as she flew down in front of her childs body lashing out. Lorena drew back her sword and with the first swipe dropped her to her knees, lifted her sword her and slammed it through her body, destroying her.
