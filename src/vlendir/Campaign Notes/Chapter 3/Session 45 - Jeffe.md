## General Summary

Graa and Lorena arrive at his room, 4 walls, plain, one wall does look a little too far in and a raised bunk with a bookshelf. And some activity space. In the middle of the room Hiraani stands with a grin on his face. Getting a good nights sleep they head down to the dock with the horses to find a ship.  

 They are met by Captain Jeffe (yef-aye) Dark skinned female human, mid 20s lean and bright eyed. A wide smile across her face which accentuates a scar running down the side of her face just off the side of her eye down to her chin. Whistles alot and looks directly into peoples eyes when she speaks. Wears a pirate captain type hat with dreads coming to her shoulders. She is sat on a cannon facing away from them, legs dangled either side looking out at the sea.  

 They set sail on a medium ship Sloop named The Speedy Jewel. It has the Giant M on it white on blue. It is 2 nights on the ship arriving early the next morning.  

 On the 2nd night, Graa is visited in a dream by The Keeper. Mentions how close Crispin is to him and the stick he gave is fancy, but a flask of perpetual booze is better. Acts jealous but insists he is not. Graa awakes to the flask. Crispin is such a bore and an annoyance. Those books you stole about Necromancy, you still have them? What did you see?  

 Hiraani is visited by Aislaine. Again a open fey field with a cliff falling into a violent sea and a muted storm. Speaks a word of warning to him. He will be challenged when he returns home, but if he wants an end to this darkness within, he needs to face it. Even if he destroys this curse upon him, he will always carry a part of the darkness within him. However he will have control.  

 Lorena dreams she is swimming under water, eating fish. A shark appears in front of her and attacks, he lets out a spell and wakes up coughing up water. She now has the ability to cast that spell after being linked to Dragon.  

 On the journey, Graa attempts to Mage Hand a massive amount of fish on board as everyone else uses rods, much to the astonishment of the crew!  

 As they arrive in Lambel, night set on the back of a good tail wind, Captin Jeffe says "May the wind be ever at your back" and her and the crew head into Lambel for a well earned drink.  

 Lambel has a mix of human, dwarves and elves, the busy port specialises in trade with the main land via Khelbor, Duvia and Sandrun.  

 The architecture of the town is Elven at its foundation, large solid and smooth slabs of rock with delicately carved runes prop up all the buildings in the first half of the town with wooden and brickwork replacing what once was representing a more Human and Dwarven styling of housing. The further through the town you go, the more the culture of the elves disappears as the years of the towns growth has led to multiple cultures having an influence on it.  

 A mix of ships can be found here. Over the Emerald Sea are mainly huge galleys carrying armed mercenaries and huge cargo.  

 Smaller ferries and light weight craft scatter the gap between Khelbor.  

 The medium sized ships can be seen travelling across Scarpids bay.  

 South of the city are lines of carts and tradesmen transporting wares towards the Elvan capital A'halin.  

 Finding an Inn they discover a bar run by an old friend, Eric Blinded who welcomes them into the pub and offers them room, food and drink.  

 Graa felt displeased about a uptight bunch of arty folk sat at one of the tables. He cast Infestation against one of them as he almost kills the lad cast on as bugs come out of his eyes and nose eating at his skin. The whole table gets up and rushes him out leaving the table free.  

 Have a few drinks, the group get a good nights sleep and awake to a fresh morning.
