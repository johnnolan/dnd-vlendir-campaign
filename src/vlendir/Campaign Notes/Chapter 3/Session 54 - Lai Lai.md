## General Summary

Surrounded in a feywild forest with a small lake and a small island in the middle of it, the group look around for what is happening. In the middle they see a horn standing on top of a log and beside them a broken boat and a toolkit. They get to work fixing the boat and sucessfully and skillfully fixing it, they take it to the waters edge.  

 They all get in and Graa using his mickey mouse mage hand, uses it to make duck noises to propel them forward across. Very noisely and very slowly.  

 Reaching the middle they look around to see what else is there, seeing nothing else they take the Horn of Charming.  

 Touching the water on the boat on their way back, their hands get repelled as if rubber.  

 Lorena was first to jump out into the water, sinking slightly she then gets thrust forward from the center onto land like the water was carrying her to land before firing her out onto the ground. She jumps straight back in to get it to bounce her back out again! Seeing this Graa and Hiraani immediately jump out and follow her lead bouncing off the surface in a race with Graa just barely beating Hiraani.  

 Walking out of the forest now with their horn, exiting the feywild, they walk along towards the final ride to the Lighthouse.  

 As they get closer, the sun starts to set and they get there at the edge of night. Seeing the giant lighthouse in front of them and a path of lights lighting the way, a figure approaches them all.  

 **Jakosh** a grey skinned purple haired tiefling dressed in rags and a sack on his side comes out shouting "Lai Lai!" greeting them all with a hug, flower and pulling from his bag of holding glitter over them all.  

 Asking them to come in they talk about his time there.  

*   He is from Glimmerfall and loves that he has seen another tiefling outside of there
*   He talks about Glimmerfall and its ruch in food jungle and water. It has a portal there to the Feywild and everything is amazing there all the time
*   Everyone dances, sings and makes music
*   A mix of all races, Orc, Tiefling, Halfling, Elves (Eldarin) and half breeds throughout
*   Fey creatures come and go through the portal as do others from this realm
*   He has been really bad at keeping logs, much to Hiraani's anger
*   He has done some paintings portraing his experiences, all of which show him mostly naked with a very ripped and flattering image
*   He insisted he is Hiraanis best friend... that is doubtful though
*   Lorena took to braiding his beard with seashells while he cooked and poured them wine
*   He mentions about some sailors who are camped just north of here who got attacked by a giant crab and are trying to figure out how to repair their ship without being caught by it
*   He mentions how ever since Hiraani left, there have been tales of normal sea creatures being bigger and angrier, strange waprings of their natural abilities.
*   Most sailors now steer clear of this area in fear they could be caught by a evil sea creature

 

 The group ate and talked before going to bed.  

 That night, Lorena heard a beautiful yet haunting cry echoing on the wind, lasting only moments. Something about it almost brought her to tears before it stopped.  

 In the morning, Jakosh mentioned he also hears it and finds drinking helps with the feelings it gives.  

 Packing them and the sailors some breakfast, he wishes them well and they head over to meet them and deal with the crab. Once done, maybe these sailors can help them sail out to find a piece of the ship to try and use a spell to locate the rest of it.  

 Arriving there they are met by First Mate [Ardor Bore](/w/vlendir-drusslegend/a/ardor-bore-person).  

 Blue skin with brown hair shoulder length. They have a wet look to them, water beads hang off their skin reflecting light. The smell of fresh and clean rain water emanates from him. Carries a short sword and cross bow at their hip. Ragged top and trousers, functional and dirty. Even though they look young, in their early 20's, there is a look of burden and responsibility on their face. A grim set face finishes off a powerful and well worn body of years in the elements.  

 With him was his Surgeon, Cook and 15 crewmen all eating their breakfast.  

 He explained about their ship being attacked and by some skill managed to beach their broken ship and escape to these cliffs. They can fix the ship but losing their Captain, Bosun and Quatermaster, they are without leadership.  

 Starting to ask questions of him, the group decided that first they better solve this crab problem and head down to the beach.  

 Doge running ahead with Lorena just behind, they all went down. In a matter of moments the ground began to rumble and out of the sand jumped a giant crab.  

 Roll Initiative!
