## General Summary

The group took a short rest and healed up after the battle.

During that time you think about the Aboleth and realise it is a rare thing to see and it is a Astral beast that can sometimes find their way from the Astral Plane to the material. Sometimes they find a way by accident, sometimes its on purpose.

The group went into the hold below to investigate further.

Lorena took a piece of wood from the ship and used her Carpenters Tools to carve into it the shape of the clockwork device they have found to show Crispin when they return.

They went over to the door to the cabin in the hold. Sunlight shone in from the broken back windows and inside a desk, 2 chairs smashed, paper and navigation equipment scattered and two figures holding each other, dead on the floor as well as a chest.

Hiraani stepped forward and made a check for traps check on the chest. Opening it up they find

- Shipping contract
- 25,000gp

The sipping contract mentioned

> Escorting a group from Duvia to the frozen lands north of the peninsula, waiting for 10 days and then returning them with their cargo to Sandrun.

They then checked the two dead sailors holding each other in the cabin. Hiraani looked close at them beating a DC25 investigation check.

Humans, they both had wedding bands on showing they were married. Hiraani noticed a set of letters being held in the womans hand. Opening the letters, a lot of them had been ruined, but one that could be deciphered mentioned about a person at a lighthouse and how well they were doing. Hiraani instantly believed they were his parents. More frantically searching the only other thing he found was a wooden star necklace around the womans neck.

As Hiraani shares this information, Lorena produces the Lovers Pottery Wheel and asks if he wants to talk to them. He agrees and asking the woman first

- Are you my mother? Yes.
- Why did you abandon me? It was safest this way.
- What were you doing on this ship? Fulling a contract to return these people to Sandrun.
- Why did you have crystals on this ship? We didn't know what we were doing, but now we know it was a huge mistake and we can't go back. We had no idea what the cargo was until we hit the island and sunk.
- Why was it important to protect me? We were contracted into this life, we couldn't escape, we wanted a better life for you and our Elven friends owed us a favour.

The group wrapped the bodies in netting to bring them up to the surface for a proper burial and try talking with his dad after dusk.

Tying them up to the boat wheel for later, they investigate the drag marks leading away from the ship. Graa detects a very faint Fey presence to the drag marks. These marks were not from the Aboleth. Deducing the marks to be from some sort of creature that swims and is medium to large in size.

They decided to follow the swirling track marks away from the ship, the ship slowly fading away from their sight behind. Around 600ft ahead, sight began to wain to a dim light.

Lorena started to worry about the dragon presence she detected yesterday. Refocussing on the dragon presnse from her armour, she detected 800ft in front of them a presence of a Dragon.

They decided to move forward, towards the dragon presence. Around 200ft away from the presence, rock appears in front of them indicating an island in front of them rising out of the sea. They followed up the steep incline, 150ft away from the presence.

Hiraani cast Detect Evil and Good ensuring any evil presence around 30ft of him can be detected. He also used his Primeval Awareness and detected a Fey Dragon and an Elemental.
