## General Summary

The group look around them seeing the two holes in the ground, 1 drider and many Drow and Skeletons, they engage in battle quickly killing all there.  

 Recovering, they reassure a distraught [Fvente](/w/vlendir-drusslegend/a/fvente-person) that they will find [Jor](/w/vlendir-drusslegend/a/jor-person) .  

 [Jaal Danyon](/w/vlendir-drusslegend/a/jaal-danyon-person) approaches Hiraani and explains about the streams that run around the area and why they don't drink from them. He know Hiraani has been cursed by drinking from these streams. The only way to fix it is to go down to where Jor is, rescue her and defeat the source of corruption that is down there. He passes a pair of balls to Graa and Lorena so that they can use these to counteract any sign of the curse that happens on Hiraani.  

 Saying their quick goodbyes, they all go down the hole.  

 Reaching the bottom of the hole, they step into a room long abandoned and the back of the room they come from is smashed out. Stepping out of the house, they see a huge market square built into the side of a cliff face. Above looks to be solid rock underground made of black obsidian. Looking left and right this appears to be a part of a huge underground city stretching for miles both ways out of sight. The edge of the cliff everything is built into has a river of red hot lava below it.  

 Across from them is a bridge that leads to an island. There are bodies on the floor with necklaces on. Picking one up each and wearing them, they approach the bridge where it seems drag marks lead that way and carry on to the other side.  

 Walking into a temple on the other side, the group make their way in and going down corridors reach a point where in front of them they see 5 Drow, one female and 4 male, all stripped naked with the female above them all wearing a crown of Obsidian and a staff in her hands. They cast speak with dead to find out what may have happened and learn that something powerful has killed them all and is growing in power up ahead of them.  

 They try to commune to get more information on the threat but their Feywild communes can provide no more information.  

 Ahead of them they hear a voice say "God Killers, Saviours of Dragon Spire Keep, Orc friends, Fey Touched, Slayers of Werewolves, Guardians of Jorus, come, I have been waiting for you"
