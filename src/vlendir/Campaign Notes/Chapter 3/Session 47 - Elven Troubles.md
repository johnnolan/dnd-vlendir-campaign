## General Summary

Jor angry has her bow drawn at Hiraani. Trying to calm her down he finds she is upset with him leaving her when he did and she breaks down in front of him. She takes herself over to the well they are stood by and explains what the well represents.  

 See [Corellon and Arelel](/w/vlendir-drusslegend/a/corellon-and-arelel-article)

 The Drow have returned from their underground city and are destroying the Elven sacred sites. Meanwhile her people in Jinlon stay protected and hidden in their town, protected by a shield raised by [Jaal Danyon](/w/vlendir-drusslegend/a/jaal-danyon-person).  

 She agrees to lead them back to Jinlon to return home but once there they should set off quickly for Shenar temple, there is rumour of foul play there as well.  

 On the journey, Jor gives an overview of each of the gods at play  

 Kiaransee - was the drow, lesser goddess of revenge and undeath, a former necromancer queen consumed by thoughts of retribution.  

 Solonar (M) - Elven god of hunting, archery, and survival in wild and harsh places  

 Tarsellis Meunniduin (F) - Jinlon lesser god, and Jaal believes they should worship. Elven god of mountains, rivers, and wilderness. Original vanquisher of the Drow god here 2000 years ago.  

 Shenar (F) - a minor elven goddess of rune and conjuration magic. She was a nearly-forgotten member of the Seldarine, as most elves practicing magic called upon Corellon Larethian for aid.  

 Upon arriving, Jor leaves them and says to meet her first thing at Hiraanis fathers home.  

 Hiraani decides to go see his Dad and fills him in on all that has happened since he has been gone. Not for one second does this working Elf shift from his stoic persona and accepts all that is said to him. Hiraani then invites Graa and Lorena back to stay with him and they feast on a range of vegetables and breads before sleeping.  

 The next day they all awake and head out to the Shenar temple.  

 Meeting on the road as promised, they move out of the safety of Jinlon and onward across the fields to their destination.  

 As they arrive at the temple, they see a massive stepped pyramid structure 60 feet high and stood at its top a statue of Shenar. At the bottom level of there is a dark entrance leading into it.  

 Graa out of fascination goes to the top quickly to look at the statue and upon looking at it notices cobwebs and a hand with twelve rings over the fingers graffitied on it. He realises that this symbol is in fact the symbol of Kiaransee.  

 Reporting this to the others, he comes down to the entrance and they make their way inside, weapons at the ready. The path is long and dark and a set of stairs takes them down below ground.  

 The further they go, they start to see the markings of Kiaransee crudely scrawed onto the wall in a red ichor of some sort. The cobwebs get thicker and the closeness of the tunnel gets closer before ahead of them they see a wall with what looks like a path leading in a different direction.  

 Just out of sight, Graa captures a glimpse of what looked like giant spiders running from their torch light.  

 They move closer into the tunnel.
