## General Summary

Realising the horses are in the Portable Hole, Lorena quickly jumps through the glass and releases them just in time. Confused about everything, Crispin leaves them be and heads out.  

 Taking the horses to the stable, they all headed out to find what is on the island.  

 Going to find Crispin, they find stood outside his door, [Tura](/w/vlendir-drusslegend/a/tura-person) . After an awkward conversation about boots and whether Crispin has a girlfriend called Saskia with Lorena, they enter in to see him.  

 Crispin is preparing a letter for them for safe travel. Crispin finds out that Archmage Dennis and Douglas Webb had recently died out at sea which shakes him to his core. He tells them about things to see around the island and send them on their way. They ask about Glimmerfall.  

 Glimmerfall is a inhospitable place that is talked about more in childrens fairy tales. No one has been there and come back, surrounded by mountains and a huge, dense jungle that takes days to get through full of strange creatures.  

 While talking, he signs the document and hands it over to Hiraani that allows them safe passage to Lambel on Emerald Isle.  

 **From there they can go by horse across the hills and valleys to Jinlon, Hiraani's home. From there they can go North to Leafell Lighthouse.**  

 **Crispin asks if any of them has a spell or skill that can help them track the general location where it went down. Hopefully they can find a vessel to get themselves near the area it sunk. Whatever they do they must find out what that ship was carrying or who chartered it. The lighthouse would be a good start.**  

 Lorena communes  

 1. Will we find answers on how to defeat Varalla with the Elves? Maybe 2. Should we go to Glimmerfall to go the Shadowrealm? No 3. Does Varalla have any connection to Glimmerfall? No  

 Heading out, they go to the University Shop. Graa attempts to cast Infestation on the shop clerk but the wards on the island fizzle the spell out. They all buy  

 1. Lorena: A blue cap with a White M on the front, and a blue medeis flag on a stick 2. Graa: Limited addition hoodie blue with a white M and gold trim 3. Hiraani: Flounced out of the store at the prices  

 They all went for a drink before Hiraani left early after Lorena putting on her flag and cap embarrising him. Hiraani made his way to Graa's room asking for directions on the way back. Stepping in to his room, he notices the floor panel depress and trigger a net trap that he narrowly avoids. Stepping in with a candle, he goes to explore the room.
