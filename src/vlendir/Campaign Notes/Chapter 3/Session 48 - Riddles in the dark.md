## General Summary

Continuing walking down the long dark tunnel, they walk towards the large hand mark on the wall. Graa approached to look at it and investigated it.  

 Feeling a creeping sensation in his head and a burning sensation in his eyes he almost loses consciousness as he has a flashback to an image in a book he read a while ago and coming too finds he has the ability to see in the dark more clearly.  

 Moving around the corner further down, they see a door ahead of them, thick with cobwebs.  

 Pushing open the door they walk into a room with cobwebs covering the floor causing them to struggle with movement. In the center a statue and floating off the ground 2 Drow warriors. Stepping further in they see 3 giant spiders and attack.  

 With a mix of darkness being dropped and clever use of spells they easily killed them all.  

 After the battle they went down a passage way off the room stealthily. Seeing scraping from what looks like giant creatures claws and the now familiar hand paintings.  

 As they get further down, they hear the words echoing "haha, they send me the cursed one and some play things, poor little baby doesn't like lightening". Just silence now and the occasional tapping ahead of them.  

 Peeking out Graa tries to see what might be out there but sees nothing. Hiraani prepares by bringing out his water elemental and they charge in.  

 Being met with a Undead Drider in front of them, Graa found himself stuck in a giant glass ball, Doge falling in battle and mind games they killed it where it stood.  

 The Drider whsipered in Hiraani's head about a Woman expecting him. Graa quickly surmises this must be Kiaransee, the Drow demi god behind this and the curse.  

 Graa notices by one of the fires, a small stone figure wrapped in some white material. Picking it up, Jor looks at it and realises this is a holy symbol of Tarsellis, the god that the residents of Jinlon worship and the material is the same as their robes worn. The one that Jaal uses.  

 They find the following loot in the cavern
