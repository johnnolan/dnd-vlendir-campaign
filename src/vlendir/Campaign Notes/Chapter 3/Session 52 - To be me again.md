## General Summary

Walking into the room next to them, they went to face the monstrosity.  

 [Jor](/w/vlendir-drusslegend/a/jor-person) beaten and bruised and looking to be having her life taken into a glowing crystal then into the demon. Behind the demon is a big glowing black crystal that as the water runs through it it goes into the fountain below and poisoing it, the very source of what had cursed Hiraani.  

 Key points

*   Duzokin claims he was trapped in the crystal for 2000 years
*   He was awaiting someone powerful to come and release him
*   He recognises Lorena as a descendant of Jeb Aldabra who he claims locked him in the crystal
*   He also hints that Graa knows someone who was part of the 3 who banished him into this crystal
*   He appears to be locked too the crystal, he seems to have found the ability to get himself out but not fully removed from its hold on him. He talks about killing others and using their energy to free himself. He can then use the power of the crystal to make him even stronger.
*   After he defeats them he will find the other two crystals and become unstoppable, this being the Shadowfell crystal and the others the Feywild and Astral Shards

 

 Using the orbs to fight off the curse for Hiraani, they beat the Demon Duzakin releasing Jor from his grasp and freeing Hiraani from his curse.  

 Hiraani feels the release of his shackles and even though that darkness will never be gone, he now has control over it.
