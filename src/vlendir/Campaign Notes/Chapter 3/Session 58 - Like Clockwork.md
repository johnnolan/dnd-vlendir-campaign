## General Summary

As the group gathered themselves and hearing the tale of Trillith, Graa spoke of The Weave, The Planes of existance and gods within.

Understanding that 3000 years ago, the Shadowfell, Feywild and Material Plan all converged when the ley lines were broken. Caused by a God called Asmodeus from a Plane of Existence called The Nine Hells, he reached out to corrupt a individual.

All the major religions are based on worshipping the gods in the Astral Planes. Paladins and Warlocks are often chosen by these entities to tap into their powers on the Material Plane, but only ever get a slither of this.

1600 years ago, Jeb Aldabra and two others, a Fallen Angel from Elysium and another unknown made a device to temporarily fix the Ley Lines moving them back to where they should be, restoring order.

They were never properly fixed.

With lots of questions for Crispin, they found a piece of wood from the ship they had been tracking to allow Hiraani to track its location undersea and found a note from Trilliths Father, wishing him well on his quest to help the other races of Vlendir in the fight.

Moving back to the ship, the 3 of them rested for the night but not before sharing a drink with Ardor. He explained his upbringing of what he remembered in Duvia, his love of his Mum before she was taken from him and his struggle of being a Water Gensei (Half Human, Half Djinni).

Resting for the night, the group set sail to the location of the ship, put on their diving equipment and made their way towards the ship.

Upon reaching it, Graa kept a look out while Hiraani and Lorena went through the trap door on the deck. The ship had been covered in a slime around it, but they noticed with keen eyes, drag marks leading away from the ship.

Inside they found a smashed crate as well as 3 dead bodies floating still in the water. Out of the crate laid a intricate, clock work, golden object. With legs at the bottom, the middle was a set of exposed clockwork parts and the top leading up with 3 arms that looked like they could hold an object. A large Crystal Shard.

Two of the shards were missing while one was smashed on the floor, a new type not seen before, a white colour to it but smashed into tiny pieces.

They realised of these 3 there, one smashed, one missing and the other must be the Shadowfell crystal they hold in their Bag of Holding.

Knowing all this, their options were to

- See if they could find where the other crystal had gone
- Speak with Crispin about all this history they had found and this device
- What was the other type of crystal that is now broken on the floor
- What did any of this have to do with the Water Djiini that granted Hiraani his wish on the night he tried to save this ship
