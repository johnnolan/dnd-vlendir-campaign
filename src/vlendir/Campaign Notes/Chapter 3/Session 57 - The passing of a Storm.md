## General Summary

The group spoke to the Storm Giant.

### Trilliths Tale

Since this has happened he is trapped behind the fog but is thinking for himself again on and off, passing in and out.

Know he must be killed, asks them to when he turns. He cannot go on corrupt like this.

He speaks of the age before the rebalancing, 3000 years ago when Asmodeus, the lord of the nine hells, had his puppet break apart the weave and disrupt the flow on the material plane causing the Feywild and Shadowfell to all merge into one. The inner planes began to fall in on themselves, making a path for the lower planes and the Nine Hells to break through taking all.

But a small group led by a Fallen Angel from Elysium created a device that could rebalance the ley lines. It did not fix it as they were not powerful enough.

When it happened, I became trapped here like many others. But the device has been destroyed.

They took down Trillith fast with a wise move to freeze him in place by Graa.
