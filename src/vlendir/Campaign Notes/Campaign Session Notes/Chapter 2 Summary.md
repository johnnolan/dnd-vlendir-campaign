### Riverspire

 The group made their way south to their new cabin. However something happened on the way, they walked into what appeared to be the Feywild, a bubble of sorts where the plains had somehow conjoined together. A thing that as far as they were aware had never happened before.  

 On the way they passed through a town called Riverspire. Finding it full of misery and paranoia as well as hatred towards Graa for being a Tiefling, the group soon discovered the reason this human village hated anything other than their own species was the demon attacks and werewolf attacks that had killed nearly all their noble warriors and slowly a net was tightening around the village. Not able to farm for fear of death, the town was in ruins.  

 They met with Barry the Bastard and Chad Thundercock who worked for the Major - Ivan - who seemed turned out to be a rich boy from Duvia trying to prove his worth.  

 They also met with two others, an elderly Eldarin Elf Druid named Saskia and a little boy named Harry. Harry took an instant liking to Graa and after writing off any evil from Saskia as the villagers were determined to pursue, the group found themselves working with the pair to hunt the werewolf and rescue the village.  

 Finding out the Mayor was indeed the werewolf they rescued the town and set it up to begin restoration in conjunction with Phandelver.  

 **After killing the Werewolf they noticed again a similar meta as a ring on the werewolves finger. After destroying the beast, they once again saw a visage of Varalla, pissed off. She offered them each to join her, she could grant them powerful magic if they forgo their alliances to the Fey. No they said!**  

 Arriving back at Saskias, they talk about the following  

 Sitting down in the house at the table and grabbing multiple bottles of wine, the group take some time ask questions.

* **Saskia tells the group that Varalla was not Fey but from the Shadown Realm**
* As they discussed about what to ask in the Commune sessions, Saskia offers to let them visit the Feywild to speak to their dieties.
* **Just like the Feywild where stories of pixies, moving trees and hags come from, the Shadowrealm is its equal in werebeasts, vampires and zombies**
* **Saskia was born in the Feywild, half elf, half Fey creature and brought back to the material plane as a young child never to return**
* **It has been a long time since she has heard of anything from these planes crossing. So long that these creatures who used to be seen have turned into childs stories and myth. Until now.**
* **Saskia was raised in Glimmerfall but has never been back as its too dangerous**
* Saskia allowed each of them to visit the Feywild to talk properly with their Dieties

#### Hiraani Trip

Key points  

* She appeared to have a slight crush on The Keeper with some sort of history
* Faen and Doge are mirror images between the planes, everything Doge sees, she sees
* "Its not about being a hero, its doing the right thing" is exactly why she chose him
* **Whatever happened to the ship he tried to save and his interference, caused something to happen with the planes. Like something broke between them and they could see into this plane**
* She saw instantly Hiraani, his heart and what this creature was cursing him with. She chose to help in that instant
* **They need to find what was in the ship somehow as well as break the curse**
* **He needs to destroy the Water Djiini to end the curse**
* **They need to find a way to restore the inblanace.**
* **To find the Djiini, start at where you found the book**

#### Lorena Trip

Key points  

* Varalla probably doesn't know about the Dragonkin... however she probably knows now
* Not previously been an enemy and never heard of her before
* **Fey cannot see anything from the Shadowrealm and nor they can see what happens with the Fey**
* **She also cannot see the party due to the Fey powers within them**
* Her eyes have probably shifted from Phandelvin to other stronger places
* Look to the Jorus for what may be the biggest threat
* Lorena will need all the people behind her if a giant battle commences and the Jorus is one of them
* She grants Lorena stronger powers through her armour to help her be more agile in battle
* Lorena needs to find out why and how this inbalance is happening
* The Dragonkin will try and research more about what might have happened in their historical books

#### Graa Trip

Key points

* The Keeper has a bottle of infinite booze
* Sees alot of himself in Graa and very happy with how well he is doing
* **Kind of worried about Varalla as if things go inbalanced, he could lose a lot of his fun time and risk the Feywild being destroyed. Very uncool.**
* Definitely a decent guy
* Will look through his books of all the history around this inbalance and what could be causing it
* Has a massive collection of Tombs to dig through
* Suggests sticking with that Crispin fellow

 They spoke briefly about their experiences including Hiraani's need to destroy a sea Djiini (Water Ghost) and what each of them learnt before starting to plan how they should approach the village.  

 Wondering about Crispin and whether they should try and contact him, Graa realised it would probably be a couple of days/a week before he would have any information for them.  

 Speaking to Saskia about who should become the next town Mayor, they suggest herself to which Saskia seemed not keen on, but she suggested Kira as an option. A strong willed Inn Keep who's family has long roots set in the town history.  

 They chartered a ship with Captain Lee, Innkeeper Kiras dad to go across the lake to Hunters Rest.  

 Arriving at Hunters Rest, they went down to the cellar to check for Ale and found an old puzzle in there. Solving it they found a teleportation circle activate allowing Graa to memorise and teleport back here at any point. Spending the night drinking, having conversations and Hiraani smoking his new pipe of story telling they head back to the ship and back to Riverspire to start heading towards The Jorus after rumour of instability in the region of late. Saskia agrees to put wards up on the house to protect it.  

### The Jorus

 Heading out on horseback to the Jorus and on to Aldabra, the group thunder at great speed unhindered due to Hiraanis survival skills. Endless days it took to go across, but as they approached Autmnrun they were ambushed by a group of soldiers, Lorena immediately recognised them as her fathers (Monty) men.  

 Captain Fontaine who led them quickly makes it clear they are to be escorted to Aldabra to see her father. With threat of handcuffs, they are escorted to Aldabra.  

 Pulling up outside, the captin and the soliders dismounted and approached the guards outside the entrance to the building. As the now mroe senior soldier stepped forward, he barated the Captain for not having the manicles on them and reluctantly and rudely made them go into the building.  

 As they stepped into the entrance, they saw a beautiful stone interior, two stair ways either side of them leading onto a upper area covered with archers at the ready. In the center of the room were 3 giant wooden tables and past them were two thrones upon a dais.  

 Sat in the throne was Bryce. Alongside him a beautiful, tall, pale skinned woman and another male off to the side that looked just like her, idally picking his nails.  

 As Lorenas gaze passed to the side of the dais she saw her father, unshaven and exhausted, led on a cushoin to the side. Bryce and his female friend ignored them at first before turning their attention to them. Bryce talked about how Lorena should have taken him, now look at his, sat here ruling all of the Jorus and soon to become King with his new lover. Identifiing herself as Ameline and her brother Henfry. She begins to ask them to join them should they wish, they would do well under their rule.  

 At this Lorena explodes and begins shouting and cursing at them. They get dragged out as everyone in the room starts to laugh at them and are dragged down towards the dungeon. On the way down the stairs, furious, they are met by 3 new guards who offer to take them down and lock them up. As they take over, one of them holding Lorena pulls his sleeve up showing a tattoo of a circle and three lines like an upside down sunrise/sunset.  

 Understanding this is one of the Scarlet Order, they take them to a dead end and open a grate on the floor before going into the sewers and making their way out of the city hearing a massive fuss above their heads. As they exicted out of the town through a gate out, they found their horses ready and tied up before charging full force away from Aldabra towards the Rebel camp to hopefully find more answers.  

 Riding on, south through the Jorus flats, they ride hard getting distance between themselves and Aldabra.  

 As the horses start to struggle, they pull up with the other 3 riders and the lead soldier suggests them to rest for a cold camp tonight and begins prepping them for a nights sleep.  

 His name is Grimbold, his two riding partners, Aron and Theron, a part of the Scarlet Order. They were stationed there as a fall back to help save them on orders of Lorena's Uncle Rab.  

 Lorena excited by the prospect of seeing her uncle again explained that news of issues in Jorus had reached their ears and they were on their way to see what was happening.  

 Asking about the twins, Grimbold explained he has spoken to Rab and a mage counciller, Ebras, from her dads court who had escaped. Ebras has true sight allowing him to see through illusions. He noticed 6 months ago, Henfry had turned up and somehow managed to speak to her father and get access to the court.  

 Ebras saw all through this and was terrified. He could see who these two new people were. They were a Succubus and a Incubus.  

 Telling Rab, they made out with Ania and those most loyal south leaving behind only those that could not leave for fear of their family being killed.  

 He went on to explain that Monty knew about the Scarlet Order and supported them. In order to keep your enemies close and strike deals to ensure no one meant evil to the populace.  

 The Scarlet Order had worked behind the scenes as this unfolded to help people escape and rescue her mother, she is after all from the common people and they love her.  

 Her brothers are locked up in the cells below the keep, out of the way and they cannot get them out.  

 As they finished the conversation, the scarlet order ripped off the badges of house Crawford and attached armour pieces and a helmet all resembling sea shell creatures. Smiling they explained that it will be the best way to distinguish each side on the battle field.  

 As they pull up in the camp, they tie their horses up and walk towards the center of the camp where they are met with a massive hug and great joy by Lorena's Uncle Rab.  

 Lorena asks about her mother and he points her to a lone figure sat on a rock on the outskirts. As Lorena approached her mum, she called out gently to her.  

 As she turned around, she saw her face light up and run to give her a hug. As they ended their embrace, Lorena noticed a small turtle in her hands. Asking about it she explained how it had come to her and followed her when the soldiers went to find shells for their armour. Looking around now she could see that all the soldiers had these unqiue sea shells on their armour.  

 The group head out to take care of a local infestation of Snake people in a temple west of them. They believe the temple has access to an old Dwarven tunnel that used to run the length of the Jorus back when Dwarves and Humans worked together.  

 They exterminate the threat, return to camp, get the army ready for an attack and head on the days long journey through the tunnels to appear in the throne room at the same time the attack happens.  

 On their way through the tunnels, just before the end they are met by two Turtle Folk, Uldon and Lila in the middle of a giant cave opening.  

 Informing them they are on their way to Aldabra using the tunnels. Going to rescue Lorena's father who is a Lord there. **Hearing Lorena is of the Aldabra's, the two immediately took note and questioned further with a Grin on their face noticing the Trident on her back.**  

 **Explaining that evil is creeping into the world, dragons, werewolves and now they are to fight an Incubus and Succubus who have taken Aldabra. They hadn't heard about anything this evil since the great rebalancing. About 1500 years ago, the realms were one and chaos reigned. Split, the planes were put into order having the Shadowrealm and the Feywild sit alongside the Material plane. Everything that was left of these creatures was wiped out leaving only traces of their existance while they thrived in their own. Peace reined and magic slowly faded. Lorena asked whether it was relevant that her mother had found a Dragon Turtle that had taken a liking to her.**  

 Lila's face drops her tea in shock and grabs onto Uldon in shock. Turning to Lorena she asks for more details. Explaining that it is still alive and growing fast, they both burst into joy. Suddenly everyone felt a rumble under their feet and the orb in the middle of the room flicker violently before going out. Standing up immediately they heard beneath them a giant intake of breath as the ground shuddered. Realising what they were on, a giant and old Dragon Turtle.  

 The history of Tu'Sin [https://www.worldanvil.com/w/vlendir-drusslegend/a/legend-of-t-u-sin-and-king-jep-aldabra-article](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/vlendir-drusslegend/a/legend-of-t-u-sin-and-king-jep-aldabra-article)  

 Lila quickly said come with us and they made their way quickly to the north of the cave. As they bent down on the back of its shell towards the front, Lila explained that the turtle they found is the offspring of this Dragon Turtle. For 900 years she has been kept care of, sustaining her so that she may see one of her offspring live to carry her species on, the last of her kind. Over the years each egg has either failed to hatch or never lived past a day. We had almost given up hope.  

 This news, she must have heard it. She is fading now. The magic has been the only thing allowing her to breath since she has been stuck here... I think she is ready for her peace now, now she knows one of her children has made it. Its time to let her go.  

 As the group fell silent, they watched and waited for the next hour as the time between each breath got longer... and longer... until finally, there were no more breaths.  

 As the group awoke the next day, the prepared and attacked from underground, finding Lorenas brothers in cells and destroying Henfry who was found torturing Monty.  

 Working with Lorenas brother Ifan who had Palandin abilities, they attacked Amelie and slew her down as well as her half bastard son.  

 Taking a breath, the group decided to make their way outside to let everyone know Amelie is dead and all is safe.  

 Before heading out, **Hiraani noticed 3 pieces of a small shattered black crystal lying on the floor where the portal was. Walking over and picking a piece up, the others saw Hiraani immediately drop to the floor. As soon as he touched the crystal, everything around him changed. The smell of brimstone and mold as well as and intense heat filled his senses. The floors replaced now with grates and an endless darkness below. The walls a mismatch of pieces of metal, leather and skin. The pillars now parts of bone and bodies keeping the roof up.**  

 All around him he was surrounded by an endless army of undead creatures. Zombies, some armoured, some not, huge beasts of all sizes, mutated and waiting. Taking a step back, he dropped the crystal and in that moment, shot back to the chamber he was previously in.  

 Telling everyone what had happened, Graa didnt believe him and was offered the crystal. Taking the crystal, nothing happens to Graa. Throwing it back to Hiraani, he cuaght it and instantly fell to the floor again and was back in this horror place. This time, when he appears, all the creatures around him are facing his way. They all draw their swords as they look at him. He immediately dropped the crystal again and came back into his own body.  

 Cutting some cloth off of Amelie's clothing, Lorena scooped with her hand axe the crystal parts and wrapped them up for safe keeping.  

 Lorena flew over the city as Graa and Hiraani let off the signal with a wand of pyrotechnics, the city and lands came to peace and celebration.  

 Druing the next day, Crispin turned up and with all of Lorenas family they discovered  

* Graa found himself with a magic coin from the Feywild that had been taking his money. Rubbing it he found himself in a Dragons layer piled with gold and gems
* The sexy poo event happened...
* **The choker when broken down appeared to have enchantment magic not made on this plane. It came from the Shadowfell and also had essences of Fey magic. This makes no sense as the realms are split and should not be able to interact with each other.**
* **They explained they found crystal shards after the portal closed and when Hiraani touched them he was taken somewhere else. Didn't seem to happen to anyone else.**
* **There are different types of shards that would allow powers to work across planes, harness the powers of the other realms and even move between the two. This one is of the Shadowfell and can be only used by people who have a part of the Shadowfell in them or are completely of that plane. There are Feywild Shards and Astral Shards as well. They are very rare.**

#### Theives Guild

 Upon leaving, the group noticed a group fo people huddled around a notice board with lots of blueprints and maps of different areas of Aldabra. Trying to get closer, a huge Goliath with a massive sword came in front to block their movement. After some awkward and dumb conversation they gave up and moved towards the entrance. Looking back they could see a woman, wearing a pirate style hat and tunic with long wavy brown hair look up and give a smile and shake of the head as she watched them leave.  

 The group decided to spend their reward money on new tattoos.  

#### Library

 Crispin said he is leaving in the next day or 2 and asks if they will come with him to Medeis. **He thinks the 3 of them are important to these events and wants them to explore the possibility of something being on that ship that Hiraani tried to save and was the last thing to happen before these events. He asks if they would be willing to see what that ship contains. Any time he enquires about the ship from his contacts, they go cold and say they know nothing. He needs a group powerful enough to exploire and check that nothing is awry with it. That area is also on the continent and close to where Hiraani was raised, so maybe they can look into Hiraani's history, the shards and also this at the same time?**  

 **Hiraani searched for Shards and the Rebalancing. About the Shards, he finds out that these were common for the first couple of hundred years after the Rebalancing. Creatures would use them to go back and forth and use power from the planes in this one. Each time they were defeated the shards were destroyed or hidden from use. He also found a small snippet of a reference to their being a use of the different shards just before the Rebalancing but that is it.**  

 Graa searched for information on sea monsters and now had the ability to know the strengths and weaknessess of common sea creatures in Vlendir.
