They all awoke, not knowing each other in a new town Phandelver. Went and asked questions of the barman who they scared at first and found no answers before bullying an old drunk who had no idea who or what they wanted. Giving up they decided to pick a quest from the quest board to see if they could find more information.  

 You all met many friends along the way. Key among those were  

 Big Al whos farm you saved and who gave you each a Glass Drinking Skull before heading off to Bhurgarom with the staff that Elva Gwennip had carried who was killed by Varalla to see if the Dwarves could enchant it.  

 Don Jon the cowardly mayor of Phandelver who gained his courage to lead his village to attack the forces of Varalla. He also gifted you your house to stay in.  

 Falcon the hunter who taught Hiraani some skills with the bow and clumserly gifted Lorena a whittled dragon turtle before you all left.  

 You all slayed Cryovain on the top of Ice Spire Keep where you took your Gnome friends and a party of Orcs who had been driven out and you befriended to work together.  

 Upon slaying Cryovain, the magical ice barrier that had surrounded Phandelver was destroyed and you made your way back to town, but not before handing over a sending stone to talk with the Orcs before you left.  

 **You also noticed a circlet around the dragons neck, what was glowing in battle now just disenchanted with its death.**  

 Upon coming to the town you found it burning with demon creatures killing and Varalla facing Elva and Falcon outside the pub as a last stand.  

 She kills Elva in front of you and disappears not caring about the three of you, dismissing you as too weak to bother with.  

 The next day, a familiar face to Graa enters the town, Crispin, with his assistants Tura and Falinit.  

 Tura , a Half Orc in full plate male and a sword in her hands with no scabbard visible looked stern towards them.  

 Falinit Fallynd, a skinny half elf, holding a quiver and book furiously writing in his book.  

 He explained he had made his way to the area after hearing about a giant ice wall and dragon to see what it was, study it and help if it was real.  

 Crispin gave them guidance on each of their connections made throughout the past month.  

 They found that each of them had one way or another been helped by creatures from the Feywild.

* Hiraani - Aislaine, The Maiden
* Graa S'oua - The Keeper
* Lorena Aldabra - Lorena Dragonkin

 **He explained to Hiraani that the curse was done by a Djinni and he needs to find a way back to the lighthouse he came from and find a part of the book he read from to hopefully use Graa S'oua 's magic to locate the entity and beat it.**  

 He then took the object that was around the dragon and casting a spell identified that it was a Enchantment that was cast on the object to control the dragon.  

 Putting it all together he realises that there may be something larger going on at play.  

 He will take the object away and contact them once he has more information.
