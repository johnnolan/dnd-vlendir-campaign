## Key Battle Notes

### Resistance

You have resistance to Fire

### Tides of Chaos

Once per long rest, you can gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

### Sorcerer Points

#### Empowered Spell - Reroll your dice

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll up to +2 of the dice. You must use the new rolls and you can use this option even if you've already used another Metamagic option.

#### Seeking Spell - Miss an attack? Reroll to try again

If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 sorcery points to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll. You can use Seeking Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

#### Distant Spell - Double the range of your spell

When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 ft. or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell (or make the range 30 ft. for a spell with a range of touch).

#### Magical Guidance - Reroll a failed ability check

When you make an ability check that fails, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll, potentially turning the failure into a success.

#### Twinned Spell - Target 2 enemies instead of 1 for your spell (2 firebolts?)

You can spend sorcery points equal to a spell's level (1 for a cantrip) to target a second creature in range with the same spell, as long as the spell at the level it's being cast is incapable of targeting more than one creature.

#### Bend Luck - Remove 1d4 from an enemies roll

When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creatureâ€™s roll. You can do so after the roll but before any effects occur.
