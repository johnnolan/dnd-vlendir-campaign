## Action Surge - One more hit per long rest

## Second Wind - Regain health once per long rest

## Menacing Attack - Supe Die - Scare the buggers

When you hit with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to add the total to the damage roll and the target must make a WIS saving throw (DC +15). On failure, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

## Trip Attack - Supe Die - Trip them prone after an attack

When you hit with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to add the total to the damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a STR saving throw (DC +15). On failure, you knock the target prone.

## Know Your Enemy - Not RATM - 1 minute to learn things about the creature

If you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn information about its capabilities compared to your own: Strength score, Dexterity score, Constitution score, Armor Class, current HP, total class levels (if any), fighter class levels (if any)

## Reactions

> You can only make one reaction per round

### Sentinel - Creature close to you attacks another person? Make an attack

When a creature within 5 ft. of you makes an attack against a target other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.

### Sweeping Attach - Supe Die - Roll a 1 or 2 for damage? Roll again

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

### Brace - Supe Die - Moving away from you? Attack and add 1 supe die to the damage

When a creature you can see moves into the reach you have with the melee weapon you’re wielding, you can use your reaction to expend one superiority die and make one attack against the creature, using that weapon. If the attack hits, add the superiority die to the weapon’s damage roll.

### Riposte - Supe Die - Creature misses? Attack and add 1 supe die to the damage

When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against it (add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll on hit).
