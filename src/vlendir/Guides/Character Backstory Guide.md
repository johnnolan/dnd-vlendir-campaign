Backstories can be as long or as short as you want. It is up to you how you want to flesh out your character and there is no right or wrong way.

Some people find it hard to come up with some basic points to help them roleplay the character, like making skill choices, reacting to situations, etc.

If you are struggling with being creative and just want to get some basic high level point down for your character, you can use the following questions to write a few bits to help you explore your character in the future, base your decisions on and help the DM create stories that may strike a chord with your character.

**Q1: Why is your character adventuring? (required)**



**Q2: What motivates your character? (required)**  
_(select 3 max)_

- Helping people
- Serving a cause
- Money
- Power
- Knowledge
- Other (please specify)

**Q3: Where did your character grow up?**  
_(Outline any locations, people or events that had an effect on your character. Short bullet points are easier to incorporate into the story)_

**Q4: Why is your character their current class?**  
_(Does this tie into the reason they are adventuring? Did they have a mentor?)_

**Q5: Does your character share a special attachment with any people, places or things?**  
_(The special attachment doesnâ€™t have to be a good one)_

**Q6: Does your character have a secret?**  
_(1 max)_

**Q7: When has your character failed?**  
_(At least 1)_

If you are still struggling then there are backstory generators online like [](https://www.kassoon.com/dnd/backstory-generator/https://www.kassoon.com/dnd/backstory-generator/). A search for D&D 5e backstory generator should bring up plenty of links with ideas.
