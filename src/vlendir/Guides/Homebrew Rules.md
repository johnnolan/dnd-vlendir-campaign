### Attunement

- You can have 4 attunement slots
- 3 are standard slots
- The 4th is for items that do not increase your power however aid in your interactivity elements. Such as alerting you to danger, assuming a disguise, etc.

### Bonus action in combat

You can do the following as a bonus action

1.  Throw a object from your inventory but not to hit. So no throwing weapons, however bombs, potions, poisons and rope is fine
2.  You can use any type of potion

### Healing Surge

Source: [https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#HealingSurges](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#HealingSurges)

This optional rule allows characters to heal up in the thick of combat and works well for parties that feature few or no characters with healing magic, or for campaigns in which magical healing is rare.

As an action, a character can use a healing surge and spend up to half his or her Hit Dice. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.

A character who uses a healing surge can’t do so again until he or she finishes a short or long rest.

Under this optional rule, a character regains all spent Hit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short rest, a character regains Hit Dice equal to his or her level divided by four (minimum of one die).

For a more superheroic feel, you can let a character use a healing surge as a **bonus action**, rather than as an action.

> We will use this as a bonus action
