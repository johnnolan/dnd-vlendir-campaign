## Overview

**Careful Spell**: make your friend take just half damage, instead try to avoid your friend from the start, and hope they succeed their own dex save.

**Distant spell**: double the range of spell or transform a touch spell into a 30ft spell. This can be very useful especially with touch spell like vampiric touch, but I don’t really see the point of a 300ft fireball range.

**Empowered spell**: can be cast after you roll damage, when you saw that you roll 5 1’s for example. Can also be use on top of other metamagic. This is VERY powerful IMO, should be taken at level 10.

**Extended spell**: double spell with a duration of 1minutes+. Can be good with certain spell especially delayed fireball if you are able to wait without losing concentration to create a massive 32d6 damage.

**Heightened spell**: might cost 3 SP but giving disadvantage to the target can be very good when you want to make sure your spell will land, like a spell level 9 disintegrate ray. Should be taken at level 17 because of the cost of being so high.

**Quickened spell**: casting an extra cantrip, you can read this as add an extra Xd10+5 if you are a fire dragon casting firebolts, or Xd8+5 slow the target by 10ft if you’re a cold dragon etc… some spell have continuous effect costing you an action to activate (like witch bolt) and you can quicken a non cantrip spell and keep that spell activated, so while you keep restraining 2 targets using twinned telekenisi, you can cast a quicken fireball to take care of weaker monster. should be taken at level 1

**Subtle spell**: can be very useful when you need to be stealthy or to escape being tie up.

**Twinned Spell**: doubling the potential of single target spell (like disintegrate) double the number of person you can control using single target control spell (like hold person, telekenisis) double the number of person dying from power word kill etc… Or even double the amount of buff people you can target (casting polymorph or haste on both the fighter and the rogue for example. This should be taken at level 1
