## Insight Check

Not sure whether you trust what an NPC is saying? Or want to read the person more? You can call and insight check after someone has finished speaking to see if they are lieing or you can tell if something is off.

## Basic Tips

A player can assist another player on a roll, granting them an advantage on that check. However, you cannot assist another player unless they are using a skill you are proficient with. For example, if you are not proficient with thieves tools, you cannot assist the other players attempt to use them to pick a lock.

Don’t forget that you can delay or even prepare your action in combat! For example, you are playing a tanky warrior and you want to stand guard for your teammates. You can declare that you would like to prepare an attack action for when a goblin gets within melee range of you and suspend, or Delay your action PHB pg. 193) your turn until that happens. This can be risky as a prepared action has a chance to not trigger, depending on what happens during the round.

It is not possible to cast two spells in the same turn. A cantrip is a lower potency spell that you do not have to expend any magical energy to cast. A spell is of greater potency requires magical energy which is replenished after 8 hours (or a long rest) with some exceptions. Looking at you, Warlock. However, it is possible to cast a spell and a cantrip in the same turn with the right abilities.

## Fighter Tips

Action surge is the keystone of a fighter. Not only gaining extra attacks but once per short rest (1 hour), you can take an additional action. Don’t be shy in using this nor for asking for that needed rest afterward.

Fighters gain access to two more ability score improvements than other classes, giving you more options to be able to truly make the weapon master of your dreams. Mixing this further with variant human as a race and you’ll have more than a few options at your disposal.

## Ranger

It’s important to remember that Rangers are a hybrid class. Their strength is found with you use their martial skills and spells together like with the Hunter’s Mark spell. Be sure you are using your support spells!

## Sorcerer

Meta-magic feats are love and are part of what separates Sorcerers from their other arcane counterparts. Carefully consider which would benefit your playstyle most with Quicken Spell and Twin Spell being favorites.

A potent combination is Silent Spell and the spell Detect Thoughts will allow you the ability to read minds without people knowing you are doing it.
