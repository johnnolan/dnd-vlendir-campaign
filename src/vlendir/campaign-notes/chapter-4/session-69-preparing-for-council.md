## General Summary

1. Arrival and New NPCs

• Adam: The owner of the magic shop Adam’s Arcana,.
• The Tailor (The Boastful Bard): An unnamed High Elf who was deeply emotional, crying tears that turned into flower petals when Graa described his desired outfit.

2. Key Facts & Intel

• Communing: Lorena successfully communed with the Dragonkin, confirming that Magnus is alive, the Elves intend to help, and Falcon is still true to her.

3. The Shopping Spree

Magical Items (Adam’s Arcana):

• Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion Scroll: Purchased for 25,000gp (haggled down from 35k by promising to mention the shop to the Queen). Split between Hiraani and Lorena,.
• Potions: 10x Standard Healing, 3x Superior, 2x Supreme,.
• Dancing Monkey Fruit: A fruit that makes the eater dance for one minute (10gp).
• Caltrops: 5 bags.

The Outfits (The Boastful Bard): The party wanted to look "ostentatious" for the War Council.

• Graa: A robe that looks like a shifting night sky with stars moving independently, red shimmering slippers, and a Fedora (which the tailor made on the condition Graa tell no one who made it)-.
• Lorena: Did not get a new outfit but had her armor accessorized with pearlescent orange decals and a matching tassel for her trident,.
• Hiraani: A deep green cloak that looks like it was grown from a leaf, with matching decals.

4. Antics & Drama

The Fedora Incident (Bathhouse Drama) While relaxing at the spa before bed, Hiraani and Lorena conspired to prank Graa.

1. The Distraction: Lorena dropped her towel to distract Graa.
2. The Act: Hiraani cast Misty Step to teleport to Graa’s new Fedora, spent 16 seconds defecating in it, and Misty Stepped back to the tub just as Graa looked over,.
3. The Reaction: Graa passed his perception check and saw Hiraani mid-teleport. Furious, Graa used Mage Hand to scoop the mess out and fling it against the wall, then cast Mending to clean the hat,.
4. The Aftermath: A handmaiden walked in, saw the mess on the wall, slammed her towel down, and stormed out muttering, "F**** monsters"**.
5. Ending

The session ended the next morning. The party, dressed in their new finery (and Fedora), ascended the Spire of Eternity. The doors opened to a blinding white light as they were announced to the War Council as "The Shard Bearers".
