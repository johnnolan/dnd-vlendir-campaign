## General Summary

The Adventures started off from their battle and investigated a stone pillar which gave them a bunch of Gold coins. Moving further in they found a bunch of hidden tunnels within and found a ceremonial dagger in the robes of a old corpse.  

 Upon feeling like they had explored enough, they returned to the dwarves to collect their sending stones and had a long rest for the evening.  

 The Dwarves both looked worried for Lorena Aldabra and passed out food and whiskey to the group while chatting, getting to know them.  

 Upon waking, they promised to say nothing to people about them exploring the ruins first and made their way outside.  

 Upon walking outside they were met by 2 Orcs running at them attacking. They dispatched them with ease.
