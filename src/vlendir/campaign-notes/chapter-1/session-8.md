## General Summary

After waking from his vision, Graa S'oua found himself lose control and cast a spell from his new found Wild Magic causing the area around the adventurers to be consumed in fog for an hour.  

 They found their way out with some rope and shouting and went on to go shopping for new armour and weapons.  

 They then decided to make their way to the Inn to find Don Jon and escort him to Mountain’s Toe Gold Mine to find what is happening up there.  

 After some arrogant showing off along the way, they confronted up close for the first time the white dragon they had only seen from afar. Watching it consume 6 orcs in front of them before looking them over and choosing to fly off into the distance.  

 Upon reaching Mountain’s Toe Gold Mine they entered to find the place taken over by Wererats. After a tough first fight killing 2 of them, they carried on and encountered more and their leader. After trying to capture one of them with a net, they realised the only solution was violence and iradicated every one of them.
