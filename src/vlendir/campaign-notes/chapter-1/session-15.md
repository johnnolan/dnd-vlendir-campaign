## General Summary

After they had slane the boar the adventurers continued to search the 3 caverns around them  

 Searching each they found 2 Lamps, 4 Oil Flasks and 6 torches and 2 Tinderbox as well as a +1 shield and a Potion of Invulnerability.  

 On one of the Acholites they found a Ring of Mist.  

 They then made their way from the Circle of Thunder, back to Falcons Lodge.  

 Upon approaching the Lodge they were ambushed by 2 Giant White Wolves and a female troll. The troll appeared to have a male head hanging from her belt and was able to command the wolves.  

 As they fought, Falcon emerged from the Lodge to aid them and between them all they managed to take down the enemies.  

 Upon investigation they realised this must have been the partner to the Troll they had previously killed in Mountain Toe Gold Mine.  

 Falcon signalled to them to come rest in his lodge where he ate and chatted with the group before going back out to clear the corpses and to rest.

### Rewards Granted

2 Lamps, 4 Oil Flasks and 6 torches and 2 Tinderbox as well as a +1 shield and a Potion of Invulnerability.  

 On one of the Acholites they found a Ring of Mist.
