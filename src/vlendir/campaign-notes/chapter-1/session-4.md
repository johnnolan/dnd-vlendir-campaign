## General Summary

Upon leaving the cave of the Dwarven Excavation site, the adventurers saw in the distance over the tree line, the white dragon for the first time. It was firing ice from its mouth building a wall around the forests to prevent travel in and out of the area.  

 They went down to look at the wall but found it magical in essence and unable to scale, dig under or damage it.  

 They made their way back to town to rest for the night where they met a young Dwarf named. She shared her passion for wanting to find a new life here, work hard and find her place. She seemed distant and thoughtful and after some light chat, went to bed.  

 Adabra Gwynn, a midwife and apothecary devoted to Chauntea could be seen screaming help from the old stone windmill while a [Manticore](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/manticore) could be seen flying around trying to get to her.  

 They engaged in the fight and won. After introductions, they settled in to the old ladies windmill with full bellies and a long rest.  

 In the morning they tried to get her to return with them, however she refused telling tales of running away from danger once before leaving people to die from a dragon attack. She says she has had a long life and now she needs to save as many young peple as possible with her potions, so she stayed.  

 The adventurers then recieved a [potion of healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/potion-of-healing) and a letter to explain why she was staying.
