## General Summary

The adventures picked off from last session by taking a short rest and searching around the room for any treasure left behind. Finding some gold ore, coins and glasses, they made their way further into the cave.  

 Defeating 4 rats they continued on to walk straight into a Carrion Crawler which they dispatched with ease, Lorena Aldabra obliterating the creature with a final blow across the eyes and into the skull.  

 Upon putting on the goggles they found, Hiraani discovered the goggles allowed him to see in the dark better, although he still needs to get them properly identified to understand exactly what they are.  

 Making their way even further they ran into a group of 5 rats and as Graa S'oua smote them into flames easily, they await what else is around the corner.
