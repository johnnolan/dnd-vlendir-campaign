## General Summary

The group stood pondering what to so as Graa detected a shape moving towards them all at a high speed. Huge in size they were attacked by a Aboleth.

Graa got off the first shot slowing it down stunning it giving him a chance to let the others know.

Coming up on deck they all took shots at it before being attacked by two giant sharks as well.

Suddenly on the backfoot, one of the sharks managed to knock Hiraani unconcious panicking everyone.

With a few strong hits from Lorena holding two of them off, Graa brought back Hiraani and they managed to finish them all off.
