## General Summary

As the group came too, Lorena looked down at her armour and noticed a change to it  

 The armour had gone from a dirty steel colour to a bronze/copper type colour and seemed to have faint runes that when you focus on them they shift slightly.  

 Saskia smiling leaves them to chat.  

 They spoke briefly about their experiences including Hiraani's need to destroy a sea Djiini (Water Ghost) and what each of them learnt before starting to plan how they should approach the village.  

 Wondering about Crispin and whether they should try and contact him, Graa realised it would probably be a couple of days/a week before he would have any information for them.  

 Speaking to Saskia about who should become the next town Mayor, they suggest herself to which Saskia seemed not keen on, but she suggested Kira as an option. A strong willed Inn Keep who's family has long roots set in the town history.  

 Making their way outside, they put the corpse in a cart and hooked the horses up to it to transfer them through the tree near the town.  

 As they appeared the other side, Saskia takes a look at them and transforms in front of them to a giant eagle and fly into the air towards the town.  

 As they approached the town with their cart, they see in the market square a mass of people shouting and arguing and in the middle, Barry and Chad pushing people around and trying to keep them calm in a rough manner. And failing.  

 To the right hand side near a statue, a woman with her arms crossed and a sly smile on her face watching all the chaos.  

 Realising this is Kira, she looks at them as they approached and laughed at the sight of seeing a half Werewolf Ivan dead on the cart.  

 The group then discussed pushing the cart into the middle of the crowd while Graa makes a loud howling sound. Kira loved the idea.  

 As the cart rolled into the crowd, everyone there screamed at the familiar sound of the werewolf as the cart rolled in between them. It rolls right in front Barry and Chad who shit themselves and drop their weapons.  

 Kira gives a massive laugh and uses the opportunity to begin getting order reestablished. First dealing with a talk down of Barry and Chad before moving onto getting the town into a better working order as Saskia reappears and begins to help. Asking the group to join her, she takes them to her Inn where they can talk about what has been happening.  

* She tells them about her Dad, Captain Lee who owns the ship they previously saw on the lake and he would be find to ask for any sort of transport.
* She agreed to let them look through the mayors house
* Her rations were little but still provided them with a great platter of food to regain energy
* They want to find out where they came from
* As Ivan came into the town, he brought with him a big city mindset and it all became about money and growing rather than living in harmony with each other and trade
* Over the past 6 months he seems to have gone from a skinny runt to this huge hulking figure and the ring on his fnger appeared around the same time as the transformation
* It seems obvious now, but at the time it didn't seem that way. Almost like they were compelled to not notice the changes or accept them easily

They made their way to Ivans house to see what they could find. On the way they chopped the ring off of Ivan's body to keep it noticing the ring had no decernable features, almost like it is purposely underwealming.  

 Reaching the house, they sent in Doge first to explore. As Doge walked in, he looked around and found an amazing stick, the king of sticks, which he immidiately got down on his belly and began nawing at unappologetically.  

 Looking downstairs they found nothing, but moving upstairs they saw their previous quarters and in the room across from them, Ivan's room.  

 Exploring his room they smashed his desk to get to a locked draw and found

* Graa finds books called "History of Duvia, 10 easy steps to make friends among other economic books"
* Hiraani finds 4,000 gp, 350sp under his bed - They decide to take a small amount and give the rest to the town
* In the locked draw they find notes detailing a report back to Duvia about how well he was doing in the town to his teachers as part of his training. Also 2 pieces of diamond worth 100gp

They then went down to the kitchen and found a cellar in a back cupboard that contained a range of chilled meats and cheeses that he had kept to himself away from the townsfolk. Checking for human bodies there they found no sign.  

 After leaving they made their way to Captain Lee who was staring out over his ship out on the water. After a short discussion on his rules for sailing, they boarded as he agreed to take them across the lake to their new home, Hunters Rest.  

 As the sun began to set, they settled on board for their night journey on the ship.
