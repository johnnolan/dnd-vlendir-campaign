## General Summary

Sitting down together and making tea, the group sat down to talk about what had transpired. They spoke about who will teach Dragon and what the future holds for the Tortles. Including suggesting they help look after Dragon which they agreed with if they would be allowed.  

 Digging in deeper, they talk about the history of Tu'Sin and share a document with Graa to give to various libraries around Vlendir to ensure people remember the history of her.  

 After sharing the report, they all got some rest for the night ahead of the final journey towards Aldabra.  

 In the morning, they awoke to the smells of a glourious breakfast, magically preparred by the Tortles and ate heartily giveing them all a boost in their performance ahead of the coming battle.  

 Setting off, they made their way for the final 3 hours journey. Getting to a chamber they saw beside them a set of stairs going up towards the surface.  

 Graa began to make his way up while Lorena and Hiraani decided to commune.  

 Peeking through a grate at the top of the stairs with flickering light he could just make out a wall through the other side but could make out no more. He pulled out his staff to attempt a Detect Magic spell to see if anything showed up. Except for what he was wearing, he couldn't make out any other magic around him.  

 Lorena sat and communed with Hiraani protecting.  

 Q: Have my fathers forces reached the keep? - Yes Q: Have the soldiers lured out the guards? - Yes Q: Will we meet any resistance when going into the castle? - Yes  

 They decided to use the Dust of Dissapearence and make their way up the stair case. Getting there they forced the grate with Lorena smashing into it with a crowbar to force the old rusted metal open.  

 Stepping up inside Lorena see's immediately that they are in the cells of Aldabra. Summoning a fey spirit and water elemental to aid them, they moved invisibly through the passage to a closed door. Listening they could hear the muffled shouts of Monty and the Incubus arguing.  

 Opening the door slowly and quietly they moved into the room and launched into a surprise attack. Striking down the Incubus before he could even attack once, they dispatched the guards leaving a familiar Captain Fontaine crying and weeping on the floor awaiting his sentencing.  

 Running over to Monty, Lorena pulls him up to his feet as they embrace quickly. She asks him what he wants to do with Fontaine as he stares at him from across the room.
