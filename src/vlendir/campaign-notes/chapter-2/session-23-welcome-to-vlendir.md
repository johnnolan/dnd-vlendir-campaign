## General Summary

As the adventurers are greeted by Crispin Harding, he introduces himself as Graa S'oua's teacher from Medeis university, an island south of the continent they are on.  

 Behind him stood 2 other figures, Tura and Falinit Fallynd both dressed in the same colour scheme as Crispin Harding, white with red and gold trim.  

 Tura , a Half Orc in full plate male and a sword in her hands with no scabbard visible looked stern towards them.  

 Falinit Fallynd, a skinny half elf, holding a quiver and book furiously writting in his book.  

 Ordering them both inside to help with the wounded and check what they can do, Crispin lead the group to the side and they engaged in conversation about what had happened over the past month and what had happened in the town the past night.  

 He explained he had made his way to the area after hearing about a giant ice wall and dragon to see what it was, study it and help if it was real.  

 As the group talked about themselves a little more, he gave them guidance on each of their connections made throughout the past month.  

 They found that each of them had one way or another been helped by creatures from the Feywild.  

* Hiraani - Aislaine, The Maiden
* Graa S'oua - The Keeper
* Lorena Aldabra - Lorena Dragonkin
He explained to Hiraani that the curse was done by a Djinni and he needs to find a way back to the lighthouse he came from and find a part of the book he read from to hopefully use Graa S'oua's magic to locate the entity and beat it.  

 He then took the object that was around the dragon and casting a spell identified that it was a Enchantment that was cast on the object to control the dragon.  

 Putting it all together he realises that there may be something larger going on at play.  

 The Feywild had previously fallen to legend without much cross over in the past. However with 3 of them being affected and the woman showing up with Shadow spawn beasts, he is worried.  

 He will take the object away and contact them once he has more information.  

 He then sits them down and teaches them how to Commune with their entities should they wish to contact them rather than the other way around.  

 As the group went off, they spoke to others in the area.  

 Falcon approached Hiraani first and asked him if to follow. Taking Hiraani to a quiet area, he admits he has feelings for Lorena Aldabra and wants to be sure she has all the protection she needs with Graa S'oua and himself.  

 He proceeds to teach Hiraani a new spell Hunters Aspects to gain information about a foe.  

 After leaving Hiraani, falcon approaches Lorena Aldabra. Pulling her to a quiet spot, he opens up about his feelings and that once she has completed her purpose in the wider world, if she fancies a quiet life, he will be waiting for her.  

 He hands her an oak carving of a Dragon Turtle coming from the water, places it in her hands and kisses her hand.  

 As they day wore on, Big Al came over to say goodbye to them and offer Elva's spear before heading off. The group ask him instead to see if he can find a way to enhance or enchant the spear when he goes so that one day they may use the weapon that killed her against this evil.  

 He agrees and also hands them another glass skull after hearing that they had broken one on their travels.  

 With a fond goodbye and a wave, he headed out and on his way with Elva Gwennip lying peacefully behind him.  

 As the adventurers saw the sun setting, they packed their things and set out. Just before they left, Crispin Harding approached the party for one final goodbye and giving a long look of proudness in his eyes to Graa S'oua, seeing him with friends and a purpose.  

 As the town watched them leave, nodding respect and thanks, they left the gate, up the road and looked back over their shoulder one more time to Phandelvin, where so much has happened.  

 As they turned their backs, they made their way to the next adventure.  

 Riverspire.
