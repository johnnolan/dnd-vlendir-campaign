T'u-Sin (T-ou-sin) has lived for over 2000 years, her age is unknown.

She existed before the great re-balancing 1598 years ago. She has seen the lands shift, kings and queens rule in glory and fall in dispair. Lived alongside creatures from the Feyrealm and Shadowrealm when the planes were one.

Long ago, 1500 years ago when Men and Dwarves built these tunnels and temples, she helped protect the people of Jorus as the final evil from the other realms were destroyed.

Riding on her back, a distant relative of the now Aldabra's, King Jep Aldabra, would ride upon her into battle, shell like copper armour with a trident in one hand and a conche shield in the other. They slew down corrupt ancient dragons, demons and hellspawn bringing peace to the world.

They became more than friends during those time, she was a lot smaller and fearless in battle.

The lands of the Jorus were rich in wealth and power after those days, the glory of the world sat upon their shoulders. Without war, the people focussed on building and growing, embracing the peace there was to be.

Once King Jep passed away, she withdrew, the lands safe as can be, order restored and wanting a long rest.

That was the last anyone saw of her.

As the peace stretched on, and the hero's of those days faded into legend, the land lost its magic, its power faded and the lands turned to the ways of all kingdoms. Corruption, power and greed over the natural way of the world.

During the years that followed, T'u-Sin travelled under the crust of the lands, exploring and finding peace in those last days of her adulthood.

She came here, to rest and give birth. The last of her kind, she is able to reproduce by herself and she went into a long slumber for the past 1000 years.

Sat in a single cavern underground, a family of Tortle's found her and have dedicated their lives for the past 900 years to ensuring she lives until one of her eggs produces offspring.

Using magic, the Tortles have helped keep her lungs filled with air as her head was no longer able to surface and her body nourished.

Her eggs she has laid sit there dieing or producing offspring that never makes it past a day. Every one lost we moarn beyond grief.

In the past month, when we awoke, we found one egg hatched with no sight of the baby Dragon Turtle. We have feared the worst, another gone. And T'u-sin grows weaker.

A group of adventurers entered this cave, one of the line Aldabra holding a Trident and blessed by the Dragon Fey.

They brought news of a woman who had found the baby in the past month. They had grown a bond and from that, a spark of the old ways of magic and honor are coming. I cannot tell you how my heart feels as no words can explain this joy and hope we feel within.

As they spoke of this news, it has triggered something within T'u-Sin. Her spirit must know. Our magic began to fade. As we sat here, we were able to comfort her as she passed. As she took her last giant breath of this world.

My heart has broken but the feeling of peace was overwhelming. T'u-Sin has seen so much, been so much to others and now, she rests with her ancestors and leaves a hope no other could bring to this world.

I hope she is now with her friend, riding together into the beyond, forever at peace.

To the old ways becoming the new again.

We wll miss you T'u-Sin.
