1000's of years ago, before we had A'halin and a Queen, Elves lived in tribes across this land. Small communities dotted across the land, each independent from each other. Legend says the Drow were growing in strength and we needed to all come together as a people, but to do that, we had to choose who would be worthy to lead.

4 teenagers were chosen by the strongest clans to go into the wilds and let the gods decide who should be worthy.

Of the 4, 3 were boys and 1 a girl, Arelel. The other boys laughed that she wouldn't last a day in the wild. Drow weren't the only enemies out in the wild looking for a meal, even if she was nothing but skin and bones.

After a week together, lost and trying to find an answer, the 4 stumbled into this meadow. All half starved, thirsty and exhausted. Seeing the well, they all ran towards it for fresh water and to clean themselves. As they got there they noticed stood in front of it an old haggered woman. Ancient in age and naked, she was covered in dirt, teeth black and bird excrement over her shoulders, she welcomed them all to her well while leaning on a tree branch to hold herself up.

> This is my well my children, if you wish to drink from it, you must first give me a kiss on the lips.

The first boy approached and taking one look at her laughed in her face and spat at the floor in front of her. Walking around her he went to the well and drank deepely from it.

The second boy seeing his friend reject her, followed his lead, spat on the floor and joined his friend at the well.

The third boy approached and this time walked closer to her, as he did he could smell the stench of her breath. Taking him aback, he kissed her cheek instead and went around to the well ashamed that he could not kiss her.

The girl approached now, as she got closer she saw and smelt the same as the others, however she didn't see and smell in the same way. In place of rotten breath, she smelt the mulch of a late Autumn fall, the fauna and flora coming into bloom, the deer dung signaling life and the cycle of change. In her face she saw life, ever turning, growing and her eyes pierced like the iced lake before the thaw.

She approached and closing her eyes, gently kissed the old woman on the lips. As she pulled back and opened her eyes, in front of her she saw a figure of wonderous beauty, all smells replaced by a richer and perfumed aroma of pine and dewdrops. Now covered in a dress of leaves, this Elven beauty introduced herself as Corellon Larethian. Approaching Arelel, she said

> Arelel Aldaviel, you have seen me for who I am, nature and everything in it. You have accepted me without judgement. I dedicate myself to you and all I am, I choose you to lead our people for the future of our race. I am Corellon Larethian, Creator of the Elves and the Protector.

With that, she changed form again and this time into that of a man. They embraced there and then walked back to Arelel's town, now called A'halin.

Ever since a Aldaviel has remained on the throne in A'halin, passing on their blood to each generation.

Of the other boys, each that drank from the well without her permission went home after deflated and angry. A week later, each of their villages were struck down by an illness and all perished leaving their towns to be consumed by the earth itself lost now to time.
