5 giant rock formations jutting out of the ground, looking like giant fingers sticking out of the ground.

Legend says, long ago, Gour, King of Giants fell here in a war of giants. Him and his kin were all killed and consumed by the earth making the Emerald Isle. The only part of him now showing is his fingers.
