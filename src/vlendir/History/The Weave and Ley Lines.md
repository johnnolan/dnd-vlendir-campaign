Ley lines run through each plane, spiralling inwards to the material plane carrying the weave (magic). The rhythm of the Ley Lines gives a electrical balance and harmony that keeps each plane separate while feeding magic from each down through the planes.

The outer planes magic takes longer and is weaker by time it reaches the material. The inner are stronger as their magic keeps its potency due to less time to travel.

Like a planet with a large orbit far away, the outer planes pull is weaker and orbit takes longer, time there is slower and inner realms are less important due to how quickly events happen there.
