The Dragonkin stem from a long line of warriors who are blessed by the original LeShay Feywild.

Lady Tanamere Alagondar. Standing around 6'2" in a bright white set of dragon armour matching her own and a long red cape hanging behind. Dark skin, long brown hair flowing down past her shoulders and deep brown eyes. She carries a longsword and shield.

Titania was a female warrior who had an afifinity with the dragons of the Feywild. After fighting a Metalliic dragon on the Metrial Plane, she followed it into a portal to the Feywild in the forest of Glimmerfall when the Feie moon was full.

They both fought and chased for days... weeks... months... years... before finally succumbing to the magic of the Feywild. As each of them drew back on their strikes they came to stop fighting altogether, forgetting why they hated each other. As they laid aside one another during the nights and flew through the skies in the day, their bodies became one and they took the form of a Feydragon Knight.

As time past and the Material Plane grew, there dragons were dispised and manipulated. She realised she would have to maintain the balance and have a champion on that plane to maintain order. She therefore decided to release herself from her body and pass her soul and abilities to those who were worthy and ready on the material plane. Each generation gaining a new champion.
