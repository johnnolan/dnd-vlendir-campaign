One of the oldest and most powerful Fey. The Keeper is a trickster and sociopath of the greatest proportions. Taking nothing seriously, he only cares for himself. The only exception is those who are entertaining to him or at a level of deciet as himself.

His place in the Feywild is in recording its histories to great detail. Recording in his numerous tomes, he writes all that occurs and interweaves himself in others stories to sow chaos for his own amusement.

Leading a life of gluttony and debauchery, being part of his inner circle and parties is an experience that can leave you lost to time never wanting it to end while obtaining the most intimate secrets and desires of those who attend.

Some say if he ever stopped writing his stories, the very Feywild would cease to exist.
