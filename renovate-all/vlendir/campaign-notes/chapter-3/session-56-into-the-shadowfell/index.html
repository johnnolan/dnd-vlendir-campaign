    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>After fighting the giant crab, the group spend the rest of the day helping the crew and lighthouse.</p>
<p>Lorena goes with the crew and begins helping repair throughout and using her wings to give her extra push, aids them in pulling the ship off the rocks and sand where it had previously beached. Knowing her station the men on board took great awe and respect getting down to work with them.</p>
<p>Hiraani notices that the lighthouse light signal is slightly off, knowing this to be a huge problem for navigation, Graa joins him in going back to the lighthouse to help out. They fix the mechanism on the light and go through and sort the small library in the lighthouse so things are back in order.</p>
<p>After fixing everything up, they go to find Jakosh and Hiraani tells him he will be replaced, he cannot be responsible for this lighthouse any more and he should seek out the elves to replace him.</p>
<p>As the day comes to a close, the group come back to the beach where the sailors and Ardor have set up a fire to cook and drink ready for the day ahead tomorrow.</p>
<p>Ardor Bore</p>
<p>The group manage to convince Ardor to take the position of Captain and with agreement of his own men, he becomes the captain of the ship.</p>
<p>The group ask if the crew could take them to the ship that sunk 6 months ago. He agreed to but warns them it is since it sunk that the sea creatures have been growing in size and anger. It hit a small outcropping of land called Bishops Tits, that is where they should go. Rumour is there is a lost treasure there guarded by a dragon. The haunting sound they all here every night may be the dragon or something it holds, but its just a guess.</p>
<p>Ardor offers the places of their lost crew to the group.</p>
<p>Hiraani: First Mate Lorena: Bosun Graa: Quatermaster</p>
<p>Getting a nights rest, they board the ship and make their way to Bishops Tits. On the way Hiraani uses his spells to create wind to allow the ship to move faster towards their target.</p>
<p>into the late afternoon, they begin to see specks of burnt charcoal floating in the air, a pressure in their ears and a stillness begin to envelop them. Moving closer they see ahead a giant red fog cloud with lighting shooting from within across the water. They pull up 60 feet away and anchor the ship. Getting into a boat the row in attached with a rope to the ship.</p>
<p>As they enter the fog they lose all visibility before coming out the other side of the fog to Bishops Tits, except the sky is red flashing with lighting high in the sky. Going onto shore, they look around before seeing in the distance coming towards them a Storm Giant.</p>
