    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>The adventurers picked up from their last session exploring the 4 tombs of the dead.</p>
<p>Upon inspection they found a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/necklace-of-fireballs">Necklace of Fireballs</a>.</p>
<p>Making their way out of the area and jumping over the trap, Graa lost his footing on the edge and plunged into the pit. Initially refusing help he caved in and was helped out by a rope held by Lorena.</p>
<p>Exploring further into the southern passage they came across a pile of old bones which looked like a dead horse. As they moved closer, the horse bones reconstructed itself and the adventurers bonded with the skeletal horse allowing them to ride it.</p>
<p>Finding a small tunnel in this area, Hiraani crawled through the tunnel to the other side finding another room with 2 tombs in.</p>
<p>Calling back through he instructed the others to come round and join him.</p>
<p>They opened the first tomb and triggered a trap which released acid gas into the faces. Looking to the other one they stepped back and Graa used Mage Hand instead to open it triggering the trap again. No loot was found in either of these.</p>
<p>Exploring the final path north they found a room with 2 tombs in and further ahead a room that had the skull of a dragon with a gold hilted sword and red gems in the pomel sticking out of the skull. ALongside it sat a suit of armour.</p>
<p>As they got closer they were met by a <strong>Invisible Stalker</strong>. Hiraani managed to chuck chalk onto the creature successfully gaining an advantage on attacking it and they swiftly cut it down.</p>
<p>Moving to the armour, Lorena held out her hand to touch the sword and was instantly torn away in her mind.</p>
<p>Coming too on a beautiful green island, as her sight came too she was confronted by a giant green dragon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lorena Aldabra, Orc Foe. You claim the Dragonkin armour? Do you claim to be worthy and all that it represents?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon saying she is worthy, the armour she had seen appeared on her body as well as the sword she had reached out to. Sensing it needed a command word, she muttered the word &quot;Armageddon&quot; and the blde lit with fire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then prove it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dragon muttered and calmly it went in for the attack.</p>
<p>With the first hit being Lorena's she drove a critical hit to the dragon who took the damage and smiled and the damage she dealt. In response it used its dragon breath with little effect and the battle raged back and forth before Lorena finally drove the final blow.</p>
<p>As the dragon took the final hit it burst into mist and sunk into the ground. In its place a female figure appeared.</p>
<p>Standing around 6'2&quot; in a bright white set of dragon armour matching her own and a long red cape hanging behind. Dark skin, long brown hair flowing down past her shoulders and deep brown eyes. She carries a longsword and shield.</p>
<p>She smiled as she approaches with a warm look upon her face. As she placed her hand on Lorena's shoulder she said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am Lady Tanamere Alagondar. You have earned your place among us, but your journey has just begun. Take this armour and sword and use it for good. Like others, not all dragons are evil, some are good, some have been corrupted. We will be with you on your journey as long as you wear it and do good by the world. There is change coming in the world, you will need to be ready. Keep learning and you will be gifted with more while you wear this armour. Go, show the world what you can truly be. I see you, Lady Lorena Aldabra, Orc Foe, Dragon Slayer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that Lorena was thrust back into reality with what seemed like no time passing. Graa and Hiraani shocked to instantly see the armour upon Lorena instantly and the sword in her hand fire blazing from it.</p>
<p>As they made their way out they asked Xanth if he would journey with them back to Phandelin. He agreed as there would be no show at night with the willowisps dead and the adventurers made their way back to form a war council ahead of their final fight.</p>
