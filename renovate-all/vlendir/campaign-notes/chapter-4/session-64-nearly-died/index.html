    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>The group sat down with Crispin and found out the following key information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiraani still has an element of the darkness within him that could take over, but it is under control unless extreme circumstances take over him.</li>
<li>After talking about the Dragon coming from the Feywild Shard, Crispin starts to panic realising what is actually happening</li>
<li>He reveals that his real name is indeed Magnus. He is a fallen Angel from Elysium. He wanted to help previously as the Lord of the Nine Hells, Asmodeus was trying to break the weave by disrupting the Ley Lines to cause the planes to fall in on each other opening a path for The Nine Hells to invade the other realms. However the other angels in Elysium would not interfere. Being kicked out meant exile for him. Those from Elysium should never cross over and interfere in the Material Plane.</li>
<li>Magnus found Jep and Jennifar, teamed up, fought their way into The Nine Hells to steal a book the Elves from Ahalin suggested held secrets to build a device to realign the Ley Lines before they drifted too far and that was being used by Asmodeus to disrupt them.</li>
<li>The high elves with the help from the book and 3 shards containing spirits from those realms, Feywild, Astral and Shadowfell, built the device and gave them to the 3 adventurers.</li>
<li>It was a temporary fix as they were not powerful enough to bring perminant stability.</li>
<li>The world now is a lot less magical, it used to be full of arcane devices and powers.</li>
<li>The device was put in the snowy wastelands North of Burgharom.</li>
<li>Magnus provides the group with an Astral shard filled with a soul. They still have a Shadowfell shard filled with a demon. They have the now empty Feywild shard that they must fill with a soul from the Feywild.</li>
<li>Graa discovers Glimmerfall is his home. His mother came from there. Glimmerfall contains one of the final portals left that provides access to the Feywild. This is where they should go next.</li>
<li>Before going there, they should all travel to A'halin where in 3 days leaders from all over Vlendir will be coming together for a council. Queen Caralelle will lead this council.</li>
<li>Each place they have been too, Phandelver, Aldabra, Riverspire, Undergrove, Jinlon, all have had a darkness trying to corrupt them. You have successfully defeated this evil in every place and as such has kept the darkness growing at bay.</li>
<li>It appears the goal of this darkness has been to split and isolate the Cities and Towns of Vlendir so that they cannot combine or become corrupt for whatever is coming. You have given our world hope.</li>
<li>One such place that has fallen that we know of is Duvia and the towns and lands around it. No messages are getting in or out in this area so we believe they have fallen to evil.</li>
<li>Varalla appears to appear for shorts amount of time in different areas of the world, but no one has had the interactions they have had.</li>
<li>Hiraani asked around could they get support if an apocolyptic event was to occur. Magnus tells him to keep that thought for the council. He believes the 3 of them should not be afraid to voice their opinions as they have earnt their status in the world now.</li>
<li>Graa realises that the book he stole is in fact the book from The Nine Hells. A chuckle in the back of his mind, from the book, confirming the fact.</li>
<li>Lorena sees a picture on Magnus desk of Jep, Jennifar and Magnus. Jennifar resting her head loving on Magnus shoulder. She realises, Jennifar is in fact Varalla! OMG!</li>
<li>Shook, Magnus explains he thought she had died. They were to be married. When they activated the device, each held onto a shard. She was holding the Shadowfell shard and vanished after it was activated. They searched the Shadowfell for years trying to find her. She held a darkness like Hiraani which made her perfect for the ritual. He had given up. She must have been in the Shadowfell for 3000 years. It must have corrupted her while being there.</li>
</ul>
