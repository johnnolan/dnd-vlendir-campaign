    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>The group pick themselves up and make their way out of the temple to rest and regain their energy ahead of trying to discover what is happening with Jaal Danyon .</p>
<p>As they go outside and set up camp, Jor upset that her sister could be involved in this, prays to her god Solonar.</p>
<p>Jor...</p>
<ul>
<li>Pulls out her bag</li>
<li>Lays her bow in front of her</li>
<li>Mira lies beside her</li>
<li>Pulls out her bag</li>
<li>Starts a fire</li>
<li>Once it dies down, takes the ash and covers her hair and face</li>
<li>Deer antlers</li>
<li>Random bones</li>
<li>A handful of bark</li>
<li>Crushed up mushrooms</li>
<li>Mixes them and spreads the dirt with two fingers across her forehead</li>
<li>Takes a knife and slices her hand and Hiraani's</li>
<li>They hold hands tightly over the bark and mushrooms</li>
<li>Starts to chant in a low voice with her eyes closed</li>
<li>Everyone sees the air haze over around her</li>
</ul>
<p>Solonar comes to both of them. A warmth comes over Hiraani like being covered with a warm blanket</p>
<p>Solonar Tells Hiraani</p>
<ul>
<li>You are not Elven, you do not belong with them</li>
<li>Yet in many ways you are more Elven then those on this plain</li>
<li>For helping my children, I embue you with the power of the elven kind</li>
<li>To accept it, you first must complete this journey you are on</li>
<li>End your curse, destroy its power over you and you will be able to open yourself</li>
<li>I leave you with a gift not given in a long time. A merging of our Fey parents and our Elven kin. Aislaine is known to me, she is beautiful and good. We played as children when the world was young and... Different. May this help you in your quest ahead</li>
<li>Wakes to Doge standing next to him and Jor crying. What was said to her was for her.</li>
<li>A glow of green now surrounds Doge and he has grown in size and muscle</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting a nights sleep, they awake and head back to Jinlon to confront Jaal. As they get close to the border, Hiraani and Lorena sense something below them and jump out of the way as 3 net traps trigger. Graa not moving out the way in time get caught and dragged to the floor and into a nearby bush. Holding Graa up, they see Sha'a step out of the bush holding Graa, the village Elder, hunter and trainer of which Hiraani spent a lot of time with training.</p>
<p>He laughs as he comes out giving Hiraani a hug and untying Graa. He mentions that Jaal is looking for them and they should be careful. Its at this point they see a fresh scar running down the side of Sha'a face and he mentions he has been gone out of the village for a few months.</p>
<p>They all speak and after filling him in on what has occured, they decide on a plan.</p>
<p>Jor will go ahead and get her sister out of the temple. [Sha'a will fetch the other council members and get them to meet at the temple. The group will infiltrate the temple and search for more concrete evidence of Jaal keeping the barrier up and forcing people to stay rather than attacking and defending their sacred lands.</p>
<p>As they tie the horses up leaving Doge to keep watch, they sneak into Jinlon and setup in a bush watching the entrance for Jor to come out. As she does, they see her arguing with her sister, Ti'an and in the early evening light they prepare to enter the temple.</p>
