    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>Lorena is awoken by her Trident and notices wrapped in a dark cloak, some sort of Humanoid Tiger with daggers creeping in the dark. Rising and alerting the others they all fight off the 3 assassins leaving only one, watching everything from the main room. The Tiger whispers something to Crispin and vanishes.</p>
<p>They all take a seat after the battle and Crispin explains the Tiger at the door watching was a Rakshasa, an elite assassin. The asassins live in the Shadowfell but can go between the planes at will. They can never be killed on this plane, they only return to grow in energy again to come back. They must be destroyed there.</p>
<p><strong>He informs them about the Zolmel which the Rakshasa mentioned. They are 3 overlords of their own lands in the Shadowfell. Usually they work individually but it is extremely rare any overlord would work together. This shows how influencial Varalla has become.</strong></p>
<p><strong>They realise their actions of bringing the towns and cities together and removing the corrupt from them is making it more difficult for Varalla to attack. They have become even more of a threat now against her.</strong></p>
<p>Saskia arrives in a hurry panting and leaning on her staff to see what had happened. She had set wards for detecting life here and was going to wait until the morning to visit. They she felt the evil coming in and rushed here asap.</p>
<p>Crispin looked shocked at seeing her, lost for words slightly saying she looked like someone he once knew. An old friend, one of the Eldarin, like her, half Elf, half Fey.</p>
<p>Saskia is taken aback by the bronze tint of their skin since they left.</p>
<p>Harry is doing well, reading a lot like Graa does and seems to have changed over the past couple of weeks. He is living with Saskia now and learning bits of magic. He has made a staff out of a stick to pretend he is a sorcerer and also went back to the cave to get that ring. He is addicted to just disappearing all the time.</p>
<p>Riverspire have formed a council and have struck a deal with Phandelver for trade with a few residents moving in the coming weeks to help out. Their mayor Harbin Wester is due to visit in the next few weeks. He sent message to you all. The rebuilding is going well and they are all glad you are safe and still doing good. If you need anything they will always be there with open arms.</p>
<p>Saskia has a secret word with Crispin. They all sneak to listen and they just catch the word <strong>Glimmerfall</strong> before quickly stumbling back. Graa trips and lands face first as Crispin enters. Staying still as he can, Crispin comments he must be really tired and they all go and settle down for the rest of the night.</p>
<p>Awakening, they gather round and teleport out to Medeis University. Before going, Graa is given a stone to keep, as long as he has it on him the wards will not go off. They are met by Tura and Falinit and welcomed to the Isle.</p>
<p>Before heading up the stairs of the cellar they are in, they meet with Vigo Twofoot a 26 year old male lightfoot halfling, weedy, 3'10&quot; height in training robes of blue comes running in to the room. Ignores them all and goes straight to Crispin. Crispin audibly sighs and Tura rolls her eyes as he asks how he is, can he carry anything, is he hurt, does he need anything? Crispin is patient but polite. Hands him his sack to carry which he struggles with. He sees Graa and sticks his chin up in a jealous manner.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Graa, you are back. And not dead. I am glad.&quot; Turns his back and attempts to half carry half drag the sack.</p>
<p>As Crispin walks them around the university, a giant, circular building made of mishmash parts of materials done by various students with a giant hall in its center.</p>
<p>Lorena further tormented Vigo by throwing her stone of returning into the sack he carried and watching it drag him backwards and forwards down the corridor. All the while Tura spoke of how jealous she was of how they were out adventuring and hoped to get herself some cool armour in the future.</p>
<p>Climing up through a hole in one of the roofs of a section made completely of glass, they all look around a higher view of Medeis. Towering mountains to one side encirclling it, rolling hills descend to a beautiful sandy beach and dock.</p>
