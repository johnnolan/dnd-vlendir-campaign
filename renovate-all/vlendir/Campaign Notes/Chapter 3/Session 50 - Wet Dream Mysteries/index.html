    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>The group cast Pass without a Trace and entered into the temple. Knowing Jaal Danyon will probably be in a room south of the main hall, they walk through the doors.</p>
<p>Stepping in, Lorena goes up to the door of Jaal and tries to listen, failing miserably she hears nothing not knowing whether he is in here or not. Giving up with seeing nothing of importance in this first room, they proceed through the second set of doors into the main area of the temple.</p>
<p>Working their way around the rooms that appaerared in front of them in dimly lit corridors. Starting at the top, they approached the first room and Lorena puts her ear to it. Seeing a light under the door, Hiraani looks closer and sees there is no movement coming from inside. Opening the door, they see a room specificly for guests or students who wish to rest here, nothing else in there.</p>
<p>Movign further round to the next room, they notice this one is locked, a slight light flicker of light and no noise. Ignoring the attempt to unlock with tools, Lorena casts Ghost Step and steps through the door to the other side.</p>
<p>Inside was a mini library, chair and chest, it looked like a private study for Jaal. Collections of tomes on history of the different races and lands as well as Drow history and the gods.</p>
<p>Outside Hiraani and Graa discussed what creature they could turn themselves into that would allow them to fit under the door. Deciding this was a terrible idea, they attempting once more to whisper through the door which was successful telling Lorena to put as much as she can in the portable hole.</p>
<p>Lorena opening the chest finds</p>
<ul>
<li>A book on Drow Necromancy and the practices of it</li>
<li>Books with Drow symbols</li>
<li>Various Drow symbols and artifacts that look to be collected</li>
</ul>
<p>Lorena takes the entire chest and moves it into the hole and also any books on Drow and Orcs.</p>
<p>Lorena once again fades through the wall back to the group and explains/shows what she has found.</p>
<p>As they talked they heard the noise of a door opening back from the temple entrance and footsteps moving. Quietly trying to move away and hide. Moving north back to where they came from, they silently sneak past the first room and Lorena and Hiranni make quickly for the Temple main area.</p>
<p>Graa however decides not to. His knowledge thirst is too strong!</p>
<p>He goes back into the room they first found.</p>
<p>Lorena and Graa notice he isnt there, so Hiraani shoots off to get the council while Lorena goes and waits on one of the pews with the statue that Falcon made her pretending to worship her god.</p>
<p>As Graa entered the room he waited hiding behind the open door. Hearing a door slam and footsteps get closer and closer to the room, he quickly casts reduce on himself and hides under the bed. As he casts the spell he feels a surge of Wild Magic enter his body. As he lies there under the bed, half his size, panic suddenly kicking in at the thought of what it might be, he feels his bladder start to fill and uncontrollably begins to wet himself. As the urine soaks into his robes it begins to pool out from the side of the bed. Jaal turns the corner into the room and in a panic, Graa begins to suck at the urine on the floor to try and eb the flow that could give his position away.</p>
<p>After a few nervous moments, he successfully manages to evade Jaal as he leaves the room just as the urine is about to touch his silk red slippers.</p>
<p>A very cold, wet and small Graa breaths a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Fvente, Jor, Sha'a and Ti'an are all arguing as Hiraani reaches them. Emptying the Portable Hole, showing the group the evidence they have collected, they quickly gather themselves and go to confront Jaal to find the truth. Ti'an and Fvente even after the evidence and the stories of their adventures from Hiraani still did not believe him.</p>
<p>Graa gets his little self up and moves back to the main temple room. Lorena looking up seeing this image in front of her, a very wet hobbit, what the fuck is all she could say before laughing out loud.</p>
<p>Coming back to his normal size, they hear Hiraani slam through the doors with everyone in tow.</p>
<p>Calmly, Fvente takes control keeping everyone calm. Introducing herself, she leaves to find Jaal and enters with linked arms with him into the main temple to see everyone.</p>
<p>A heated argument ensues as the group show all the evidence against him. He slowly gets more and more worked up as Ti'an comes to his side. The group see him begin to take a more defensive stance as he claims he reads and saves these artifacts so he can study them and understand his enemy.</p>
<p>Tensions heat up as Hiraani pushes and pushes. Alliances on both sides begin to take shape as everyone finds themselves moving into different positions in the room. It is all about to explode until Jaal and Hiraani turn silent and doubt creeps into Hiraanis mind. Is this really the person who is doing this?</p>
<p>As silence and tension fills the room, Hiraani hears behind him the words &quot;Sorry&quot; come from Sha'a. With tears in his eyes, an object drops to the floor inbetween the group and explodes knocking everyone back. A stream of black cloud comes from it filling the room with thunder and lightening. Hiraani falls to the ground paralysed in fear.</p>
<p>At this point Jaal looses his concentration on the barrier and all hell breaks loose. As the thunder and lightening hits the ground, they all get hit by it. The clouds dissapate in an instant and silence fills the room, everyone stunned in silence except the gentle sobs of Sha'a.</p>
<p>Jumping back up, Lorena grapples Sha'a to prevent him from moving. At that point, a rumbling starts and two holes burst open from the ground as 6 zombies and a Drider burst out of one corner next to Jor and in the other corner a Drider, 3 zombies and a Drow warrior.</p>
<p>The Drow in the top right screams at them all, grabs Jor and drags her back down the hole with her.</p>
<p>Roll initiative.</p>
