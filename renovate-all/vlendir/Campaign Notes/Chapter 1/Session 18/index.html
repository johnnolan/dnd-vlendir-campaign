    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>As the adventurers stood outside the Inn, they decided to approach the Town Major and collect their rewards. They told him of their adventures, killing a demi god and collected their 500gp. They managed to charm the major but seeing how scared he was shaking to open the door they decided to let him be.</p>
<p>Going to the Inn they met with Falcon, Don Jon, Big Al, Ulla, Pog, Elva, Dazlyn, Linene, Elmar, and Norbus</p>
<p>As they spoke about the challenges ahead, they decided Big Al should act as leader and stay behind in case of an attack by the dragon should they fail. They also suggested that Falcon be their War Chief when the battle comes. Xanth would help move heavy objects like timber for the defenses.</p>
<p>Ulla and Pog agreed to teach Don Jon how to use the Arrow Cannon and keep hush their special weapon that can aid with the dragon fight.</p>
<p>After some slight flirting between Lorena and Elva, showing off Lorena's tattoo and having a touch, they made their way to bed with a promise of some potions and new armour for Hiraani.</p>
<p>As they made their way towards Icespire Peak, they ran into what appeared to be a group of mercenaries who sprung an attack on them. Getting caught in bear traps and Hiraani taking some solid blows from their longbows, they dispatched them all. With the last fighter running for his life, Ulla fired a freezing spell that slowed his speed enabling the group to cut him down.</p>
