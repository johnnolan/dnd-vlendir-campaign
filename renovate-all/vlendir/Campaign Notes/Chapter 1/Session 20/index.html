    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>As the group took note of their inventory, they scanned the room for other clues around them.</p>
<p>Seeing the 4 symbols on the floor they decided to attempt to stand on them to see if it did anything.</p>
<p>As the 3 of them stood on the circles they glowed brighter by their presence. As Hiraani asked Doge to stand on the final circle, all 3 lit up.</p>
<p>Slowly a chill filled the air and a mist entered the room no more than 2 feet high.</p>
<p>Suddenly a figure appeared by the tunnel exit staring at them all.</p>
<p>&quot;THank you for freeing me&quot; he says and explains his servant had been trapped and warped, defeating him unlocked a way for him to come here in front of them.</p>
<p>He introduces himself as &quot;Chemosh&quot;.</p>
<p>He offered the group a favour as he is in their debt for unlocking his prison. Promising to be able to give them powers to aid their dragon fight, Hiraani decided he would trust this entity to enter his body to lend his powers temporarily. His experirence with Gods and Curses driving him to find a way to drive them out of him.</p>
<p>As they joined hands, Chemosh's form entered Hiraani through his fingers in a fog like effect. Instead of lending his powers, Hiraani found himself <strong>Charmed</strong> by Chemosh.</p>
<p>Taking control, Doge dissapeared in an instant, being banished back to the fey realm and immediately commanded Hiraani to kill his friends.</p>
<p>A battle ensued and as Graa thought, he reached out to the Keeper to ask for guidance. Shocked and a little unsure, The Keeper suggested disabling or turning him into something... unnatural!</p>
<p>Graa thinking quickly cast Polymorph and turned Hiraani into a Starfish and with a wet plopping sound Hiraani as a Star Fish hit the floor.</p>
<p>Lorena scooped him up and put him in her drinking skull on the alter while they thought of what to do next.</p>
<p>After a quick talk back and forth they decided to try and remove one of the star fishes limbs in order to disuade Chemosh from using his body as a vessel.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Graa hit a little too hard, and killing the Starfish, Hiraani came back to himself and immediately drew his swords striking at Graa and knocking him unconsious.</p>
<p>Seeing what he had done to his partner, he felt the power of Chislev come through him, warming him from the inside and with both his pain and love from Chiselev, they drove Chemosh out of his body.</p>
<p>Becoming free, Hiraani immediately cast Cure Wounds on Graa and helped him off his feet.</p>
<p>Chemosh was furious, cursing Chislev as a bitch and a whore. As his anger grew, he cut off mid sentence in extreme fear and confusion.</p>
<p>All around, the adventurers felt an even stronger chill in the air as the mist got thicker and deeper and the edges of the cavern began to dim. As the darkness enclosed, hands could be seen reaching out from the void, grasping for anything. Getting hold of Chemosh, he began to scream in fear muttering &quot;No, how is she hear, how can she come into my domain, cross between two planes, no, plea..&quot;.</p>
<p>As he got pulled into the darkness, the walls began to shake and collapse, the beams shaking and falling and always, the darkness crept towards the adventurers.</p>
<p>Running for their lives, Graa found himself stumbling from his wounds as they tracked back through the cavern.</p>
<p>As they passed the final 2 statues, Graa hit his head on one of the statues and dropped to the floor. Just in time both Lorena and Hiraani picked him up and making it up the ladder and out as the whole cavern collapsed behind them leaving any gold and jewls left behind and Lorena's Glass drinking skull.</p>
<p>As they alighted Hiraani struck Graa and argued about almost cutting his leg off. After a back and forth they eventually settled a very stressful situation and set themselves down for a night around the camp fire and rest until the morning.</p>
<p>Summoning Doge again, they left him on watch and to settle the horses.</p>
<p>Waking the next morning, they decided to let 2 of the horses free and keep the rest for the journey. After slapping their hinds to get them moving and failing, Doge silently came over and after staring at the they bowed their heads and slowly walked their way following the beside the river down stream.</p>
<p>Mounting their horses they made their way on the final bit of travel to Icespire Peak.</p>
<p>On arriving at the foot of the mountain, Lorena used her senses to feel for any dragons in the area. Finding warmth of one she managed to identify a presence above them in the direction of what they can now see as the Icespire Hold.</p>
<p>Just a short ways ahead of them, they could see a camp at the foot of a mountain passage. Sneaking up closer they found it to be the Orcs they expected.</p>
<p>Making their way close they hailed the Orcs and found 4 Orc warriors, 1 Orc Warchief and a magic using Half Orc all awaiting them.</p>
<p>Introducing themselves and settling in for a drink, they group chatted ahead of their fight the next day and finished the night with Lorena arm wrestling the orc warchief and just losing.</p>
<p>As a final chat before sleep, Pog showed them all his surprise weapon, a cross bow called the Stunzooka which is able to Stun the dragon for an entire round if it hits true.</p>
<p>Making their way to their beds, they settled in for what could be their last nights sleep on this plane.</p>
