    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>The group wake up to the news of a forest growing out in the Jorus. They get up and quickly and Lorena remembers her portable hole. Packing it up, they meet Lorena's parents outside to travel there.</p>
<p>On the way, lots of people from the city also going out of curiosity.</p>
<p>Getting there they are met with a massive Oak forest. Each tree sits alongside the other blocking entry.</p>
<p>Lorena tries to fly over to see a break but finds none. Ania Aldabra Rivers steps forward with Dragon and the trees part way allowing them all through.</p>
<p>Travelling down the pathway through the trees, they come to an opening with a small hut to one side, a bench and a beautiful clear water lake. Standing there are Lila Tengo and Uldon Tengo.</p>
<p>They find out that this forest has grown out from T'u-Sin and the cavern now completely flooded. This area is protected by a Fey enchantment of some kind and should Dragon wish to stay, he will be able to return to Aldabra at any time under water.</p>
<p>Ania Aldabra Rivers agrees to leave Dragon here and take on the help of Lila and Uldon to care for him.</p>
<p>Leaving and going back to Aldabra, the group find stuck in cages Bryce Crawford and Captain Fontaine, hands and legs chopped off. The Hiraani and Graa decide to torture them a little too much and a little too long before awkwardly heading off.</p>
<p>Heading to pick up their shopping they get a Ring of Cold Protection, a water cap and 2 Cloaks of the Manta Ray. Ensuring the trader knows of Phandelver, he agrees to head there on his journey to Bhurgarom and they gift him with one of Big Als Butter Skull.</p>
<p>Saying their goodbyes, they all go to see Crispin and they teleport via Graa to Hunters Lodge.</p>
<p>Arriving they find the place to be immaculately cleaned and everything in order. They all settle down with a drink in front of the fire in the living room.</p>
<p><strong>Crispin mentions about the shards and how they used to be very powerful. At the rebalancing when the planes were split apart again as they should be, each were the result condensed planar energy. Most shattered on creation but those that stayed in tacked were either destroyed or hidden to contain their power.</strong></p>
<p>He informs them about the Elves and thier history as they talk about going to Jinlon.</p>
<p>Graa decides to cast Dominate person on Crispin to find out more about the meeting with the council. Even though he succeeds it turns out the meeting was quite boring and nothing of note happened.</p>
<p><strong>After Crispin goes to sleep, they talk about having to find the shipping manifest that was on the ship that sunk.</strong></p>
<p>Graa also opens up about his history and how he stole some books about necromancy. Trying to read the book he accidently opened himself up to The Keeper and has had him in his head ever since.</p>
<p>Saying good night, they settle in for sleep.</p>
<p>But they were not alone... as the others slept, Lorena is woken suddenly by her Trident, jolting upright in the black of night.</p>
