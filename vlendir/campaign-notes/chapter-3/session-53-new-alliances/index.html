    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>Jor's dog Mira is dead, Doge picks up the dead Mira in his jaws and signals to Jor to get on his back.</p>
<p>They take the shadow crystal that lies there now into the bag of holding.</p>
<p>Looking at the Demon and around the rest of the chamber the group find</p>
<ul>
<li>Empty alchemy vial and a workmans hammer</li>
<li>A jar full of gold pieces 3,450 gp</li>
<li>A underground Drow City painting</li>
</ul>
<p>The group meet up with Nambil Dayvon - he is waiting for them in his home - the dead tree A little eccentric, old age means he dreams a lot of the day, not able to do much He doesn't know how old he is Still looks like a man in his early 50s, wrinkles showing and crow lines around his eyes from laughing Has an assistant who uses telepathy to communicate with him One of his skills is to see visions of the future Returned with a group of 50 warriors from A'halin</p>
<ul>
<li>Turquoise white and gold plate armour</li>
<li>Long swords, curved and longbows</li>
<li>They finished off the remaining Drow</li>
</ul>
<p>Says there is Probably no way for the Drow to grow in number again They will be all going down to clear out any left He has spoken to the The Ember Conclave at A'halin</p>
<ul>
<li>They have made contact with Lorena's father, Monty</li>
<li>Monty told the Conclave about what you have found, that there is something going on with this Varalla and people are being controlled</li>
<li>They are sending troops to all villages around Emerald Isle</li>
<li>Sending emissaries to Bhurgarom</li>
<li>Corellon has lived through the days of when the realms were one, she is preparing for these rifts to open and each land will aid in keeping them at bay</li>
</ul>
<p>After speaking about the Crystal they have found and the fact that Duzokin mentioned two more crystals, the Fey and the Astral, Nambil says it is of great urgence that they get that Fey Shard before any others do. If they can find out what this is about then get a message to them</p>
<p>Jaal offers the group gifts for their work in helping. Hiraani gets a Tarsellis Elven Chain Mail Lorena and Graa get a Tarsellis Blessing Ring</p>
<p>The group say their goodbyes with Jor and Sha'a who set off to find their place in the world and goodbyes to all in the village.</p>
<p>The group then set off towards the lighthouse while wondering who these 3 who locked up Duzokin may have been.</p>
