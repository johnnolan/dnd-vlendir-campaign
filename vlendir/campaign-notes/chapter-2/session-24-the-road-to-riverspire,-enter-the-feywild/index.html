    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>As the adventurers awoke they got straight to fishing for their breakfast. As a little competition ensued, they successfully caught and cooked enough fish for the next 3 days. Mixed with their pocket bacon, their stomachs were full and they made the journey onwards towards the town of Riverspire.</p>
<p>The first few days of the journey proceeded without much cause for alarm. Along the way, Lorena and Hiraani spoke about how the curse came to be with his situation at the lighthouse and saving the people in the ship.</p>
<p>As the days past, the scenary slowly began to change. From the tall Pine trees, low level ferns, hard grass and heather to an open grassland leading up to a small hill in front.</p>
<p>As they climbed the hill and looked on, they saw the endless expanse of Oak trees ahead and a stream running through from the mountains. As they took one final look back at the mountain range behind them, they discended the hill and left them behind.</p>
<p>Approaching the edge of the forest, they set up camp ahead of the journey the next day.</p>
<p>Preparring breakfast the next day, Hiraani and Lorena decided to sneak a turd into Graa's bowl while he relieved himself. Not noticing until the last minute, Graa became furious as the others laughed. Finding who to blame, in his frustration he kicked Doge.</p>
<p>As it hit Doge, he silently looked at Graa, then at Hiraani. He then dissapears. Choosing to leave them.</p>
<p>Feeling instantly guilty, Hiraani sees this and summons a Shrimp that will be loyal to Graa.</p>
<p>Taking a pot and filling it with water, Graa puts the Shrimp into it and decides to name it <strong><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1841377-casthion-the-shrimp">Casthion the shrimp</a></strong></p>
<p>Continuing onwards, they get off the horses and go on foot due to the tight space behind the trees and follow the path along the stream south.</p>
<p>At this point, Doge reappears and comes up to Hiraani for a scritch and Graa offers a little pocket bacon as an apology which he accepts gratefully.</p>
<p>Getting further, Hiraani decided to cast a spell to detect for Fey or undead and picks up something just ahead of them about 1/4 of a mile ahead, but not one thing, rather a barrier of sorts.</p>
<p>Moving ahead cautiously, the group approach the area and pass through.</p>
<p>As they walk, things begin to change around them. The sun gets hazier, the colours around them get brigther and more contrasted. The sounds of nature intensify and fireflies and dragonflies become more abundant and glow around them. Mushrooms popping up for all areas, the group are awed.</p>
<p>Looking at each other,</p>
<p>Lorenas armour turns a dark purple, getting lighter at the edges. Doge turns brighter, almost blinding white and luminous green veins. Hiraani's arm tattoos glow bright green and white matching Doge. Graa feels inside of him a growth in his power and a connection with everything around him.</p>
<p>Walking a little further, a small sprite comes flying and babbling towards them all, annoying them and trying to get them to come off the track towards a giant tree at the stream.</p>
<p>Not trusting it, they reject it and move away. Showing annoyance, the sprite vanishes and a moment later, a giant Treant comes lumbering to attack them all.</p>
<p>As the fight starts, they quickly attack with fire and begin slicing the Treant up. As another tree awakens, they maintain the concentration on this one tree and killing it, both instantly drop to the ground to turn still.</p>
<p>As this happens they are thrust back into the Material Plane, seeing the world in its dull tones all around them as they catch their breath.</p>
<p>Looking to the sky they notice time has passed much faster while they were in what they presume was the Feywild and the Full Feye Moon sits in the sky.</p>
<p>Hiraani reaches out to check for any sign of the Fey again, but cannot find anything.</p>
<p>Before sleeping, Graa and Hiraani decided to Commune.</p>
<p>Hiraani*   Were we just transported to the Feywild? - Yes</p>
<ul>
<li>Should we expect more of this with the Moon? - Yes</li>
<li>Is the rest of the journey to Riverspire going to be dangerous? - Indifferent
The next day, storm clouds begin to gather and they continue now on horse back for the final few days. Following the giant lake now, they see a light in front of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>That night they meet a stanger on the road, a smal halfling merchant by the name of <strong>Arrin Hillbrow.</strong></p>
<p>4 foot 5, slick back brown hair that is naturally wavy but held back by what looks like boot polish to try and make it look professional. He is huddled around a campfire, under a makeshift tent which his pony and saddle bags next to him.</p>
<p>The group approach and at first scarring him, proceed to join him.</p>
<p>He discusses the troubles of Riverspire where he is travelling from and that he is on his way to Phandelvin. Riverspire has people going missing and everyone is threatening, not interested in his wares. He has felt watched ever since on the road here and this is the first time he has not felt that feeling while travelling.</p>
<p>After these warning he offers them his wares, each decides to buy the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Trident of Warning - 1000gp - Lorena</li>
<li>Hat of Disguise - 800gp and half plate armour and 2 short swords - Hiraani</li>
<li>Ball Bearings (1,000) - 2gp - Not sold</li>
<li>Fine Mustache - 5gp - Graa</li>
<li>Playing Card Set - 50sp - Hiraani
After the trade, he agreed that he would take a letter to Falcon in Phandelvin about the Moon and the Feywild and get some sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, right before sleep, Graa communes with the Keeper.</p>
<p>Giving Lorena a silver piece then taking it back saying Psych! He laughs and goes to commune.</p>
<p>Graa*   Is what is watching the merchant, going to be interested in us? - Yes</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it interested in a malevolent way? - Yes</li>
<li>Is this malevolent presence linked to the bitch in Phandelvin? - Indifferent
Resigning themselves to sleep, they all rested to await what the next day brings them.</li>
</ul>
