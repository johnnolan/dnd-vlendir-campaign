    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>As the group question the soldier, they are met with a strange hostility with all the soldiers with their hands on their hilts ready for attack.</p>
<p>The lead soldier steps forward and introduces himself as Captain Fontaine, he was sent by her father to find her as he was expecting her to visit after hearing of her exploits with a dragon in Phandelvin.</p>
<p>Lorena, a bit suspicous, realises she does not recognise these soldiers and presses him for more information.</p>
<p>Captain Fontaine tells them they are here to escort them no matter what, there is strong magic controlling people and they ask would they put on manicles to ensure their safety.</p>
<p>The group gets very suspicous and explains nicely but firmly that no they will not. Reluctantly they agree to let them ride to Aldabra without them.</p>
<p>On their journey there, they probe with more questions to gather further information. The captain is very secretive with whatever information he does have and they continue for 3 days on their journey.</p>
<p>The journey is rough, they sleep minimally on the way and feed the horses special food to give them a boost for running for so long. The group gradually becomes more and more tired as they traverse the lands of the Jorus.</p>
<p>THe last night before they are to rest, Hiraani spots the captain by the fire, fiddling with the crest of Aldabra on his chest, as if it is losely hanging on there. As he approaches and questions him, he gets a little more defensive and moves towards his soldiers, starting to stir them. Lorena attempts to question him about Monty and any new jewellery or anyone there. She asks for the manicles to check for any sort of magic in them with the help of Graa. Looking at them they cannot find any semblance of that magic.</p>
<p>Tensions begin to rise from the lack of answers before they decide to cut the sleep short and make the final part of the journey to Aldabra. This time the group riding a lot closer to the group.</p>
<p>Furious at the way they are being treated, each decides to take their frustrations out on the group as they ride.</p>
<p>Lorena pulls her sword out and whispers Armageddon and holds the flaming sword out pushing them away. Graa tries to create an infestation of flies on the Captains horse to try and annoy him, however just misses with his spell Hiraani drops off his horse and uses Misty Step to annoy them all... This was the final straw</p>
<p>As Hiraani gets up from the floor, the Captain is fuming and begins to threaten and shout for Hiraani to get back on the horse and ride. As the soldiers circle them all, his temper gets worse and worse. Looking around, he gets back on the horse for a very angry ride the rest of the way to Aldabra.</p>
<p>Approaching the beautiful city, they saw a giant stone wall ringed city with a pair of giant gates awaiting them. Inside, they charged through the market square to the familiar smell of sea air, fish and filth. Smells like home to Lorena. Each building and wall has small shells and architecture based around shells and fish. Odd sharp angles occasionally jut from the buildings like sea shells.</p>
<p>As they thundered through the market, they went straight down a main street to the center of the town.</p>
<p>In front of them rose a giant building, its walls smooth stone, architecture and craftsmanship long lost and unique. Looking exactly like a Conche shell, inpenetrable and formidable yet beautiful and eligant.</p>
<p>Pulling up outside, the captin and the soliders dismounted and approached the guards outside the entrance to the building. As the now mroe senior soldier stepped forward, he barated the Captain for not having the manicles on them and reluctantly and rudely made them go into the building.</p>
<p>As they stepped into the entrance, they saw a beautiful stone interior, two stair ways either side of them leading onto a upper area covered with archers at the ready. In the center of the room were 3 giant wooden tables and past them were two thrones upon a dais.</p>
<p>Sat in the throne was Bryce. Alongside him a beautiful, tall, pale skinned woman and another male off to the side that looked just like her, idally picking his nails.</p>
<p>As Lorenas gaze passed to the side of the dais she saw her father, unshaven and exhausted, led on a cushoin to the side.</p>
<p>Bryce and his female friend ignored them at first before turning their attention to them. Bryce talked about how Lorena should have taken him, now look at his, sat here ruling all of the Jorus and soon to become King with his new lover. Identifiing herself as Ameline and her brother Henfry. She begins to ask them to join them should they wish, they would do well under their rule.</p>
<p>At this Lorena explodes and begins shouting and cursing at them. They get dragged out as everyone in the room starts to laugh at them and are dragged down towards the dungeon.</p>
<p>On the way down the stairs, furious, they are met by 3 new guards who offer to take them down and lock them up. As they take over, one of them holding Lorena pulls his sleeve up showing a tattoo of a circle and three lines like an upside down sunrise/sunset.</p>
<p>Understanding this is one of the Scarlet Order, they take them to a dead end and open a grate on the floor before going into the sewers and making their way out of the city hearing a massive fuss above their heads.</p>
<p>As they exicted out of the town through a gate out, they found their horses ready and tied up before charging full force away from Aldabra towards the Rebel camp to hopefully find more answers.</p>
