    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>During a nightmare, Hiraani found his way through a repeating dream of drowning, being offered a hand by an unknown fermale entity with Green skin and bright yellow glowing veins, white feathers and a warm meadow feel. He reached out and held this hand in acceptance and awoke with a White Wolf, glowing with the same yellow/green veins. Upon his armd he now has a white feather tattoo with the same yellow/green veins.</p>
<p>After awakening from the nights sleep, the group were shocked to see this fey like wolf following Hiraani downstairs for breakfast. They ate and made their way to the quest board, picking up the Gnomeragarde quest.</p>
<p>As they set off on their 60 mile journey to Butterskull Ranch with provisions for the travel and a new <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/bag-of-holding">Bag of Holding</a> as they found themselves encumbered and were offered this item from Barthams.</p>
<p>Along the travel they camped 3 times.</p>
<p>On the first day they came across 3 horses, branded by what they thought to be Big Al. They convinced them to come with them and the White Wolf helped maintain their calm.</p>
<p>On the second day they found Petunia, a cow in the middle of a field. They collected her as well and made their way onwards.</p>
<p>Upon arriving the found the farm stores billowing black smoke, 2 daed orcs and 5 farm hands all dead.</p>
<p>Making their way into the main farm house they fought off numerous orcs and found Big Al tied in the basement. After a short conversation, he took Lorena Aldabra's hand axes and made their way upstairs to clear the top floor.</p>
