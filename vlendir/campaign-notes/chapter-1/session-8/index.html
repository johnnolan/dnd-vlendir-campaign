    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>After waking from his vision, Graa S'oua found himself lose control and cast a spell from his new found Wild Magic causing the area around the adventurers to be consumed in fog for an hour.</p>
<p>They found their way out with some rope and shouting and went on to go shopping for new armour and weapons.</p>
<p>They then decided to make their way to the Inn to find Don Jon and escort him to Mountain’s Toe Gold Mine to find what is happening up there.</p>
<p>After some arrogant showing off along the way, they confronted up close for the first time the white dragon they had only seen from afar. Watching it consume 6 orcs in front of them before looking them over and choosing to fly off into the distance.</p>
<p>Upon reaching Mountain’s Toe Gold Mine they entered to find the place taken over by Wererats. After a tough first fight killing 2 of them, they carried on and encountered more and their leader. After trying to capture one of them with a net, they realised the only solution was violence and iradicated every one of them.</p>
