<h2>General Summary</h2>
<ol>
<li>Arrival and New NPCs</li>
</ol>
<p>• Adam: The owner of the magic shop Adam’s Arcana,.
• The Tailor (The Boastful Bard): An unnamed High Elf who was deeply emotional, crying tears that turned into flower petals when Graa described his desired outfit.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Key Facts &amp; Intel</li>
</ol>
<p>• Communing: Lorena successfully communed with the Dragonkin, confirming that Magnus is alive, the Elves intend to help, and Falcon is still true to her.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Shopping Spree</li>
</ol>
<p>Magical Items (Adam’s Arcana):</p>
<p>• Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion Scroll: Purchased for 25,000gp (haggled down from 35k by promising to mention the shop to the Queen). Split between Hiraani and Lorena,.
• Potions: 10x Standard Healing, 3x Superior, 2x Supreme,.
• Dancing Monkey Fruit: A fruit that makes the eater dance for one minute (10gp).
• Caltrops: 5 bags.</p>
<p>The Outfits (The Boastful Bard): The party wanted to look &quot;ostentatious&quot; for the War Council.</p>
<p>• Graa: A robe that looks like a shifting night sky with stars moving independently, red shimmering slippers, and a Fedora (which the tailor made on the condition Graa tell no one who made it)-.
• Lorena: Did not get a new outfit but had her armor accessorized with pearlescent orange decals and a matching tassel for her trident,.
• Hiraani: A deep green cloak that looks like it was grown from a leaf, with matching decals.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Antics &amp; Drama</li>
</ol>
<p>The Fedora Incident (Bathhouse Drama) While relaxing at the spa before bed, Hiraani and Lorena conspired to prank Graa.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Distraction: Lorena dropped her towel to distract Graa.</li>
<li>The Act: Hiraani cast Misty Step to teleport to Graa’s new Fedora, spent 16 seconds defecating in it, and Misty Stepped back to the tub just as Graa looked over,.</li>
<li>The Reaction: Graa passed his perception check and saw Hiraani mid-teleport. Furious, Graa used Mage Hand to scoop the mess out and fling it against the wall, then cast Mending to clean the hat,.</li>
<li>The Aftermath: A handmaiden walked in, saw the mess on the wall, slammed her towel down, and stormed out muttering, &quot;F**** monsters&quot;**.</li>
<li>Ending</li>
</ol>
<p>The session ended the next morning. The party, dressed in their new finery (and Fedora), ascended the Spire of Eternity. The doors opened to a blinding white light as they were announced to the War Council as &quot;The Shard Bearers&quot;.</p>
