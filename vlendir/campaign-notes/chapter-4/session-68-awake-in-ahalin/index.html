    <h1 class="article-page-heading">Session 68 - Awake in Ahalin</h1>
    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>Following the fall of Medeis University and the kidnapping of Crispin (Magnus) by Varalla, the party teleported to safety. The session opens with the group awakening two days later, fully healed, in the High Elven city of Ahalin (referred to phonetically in the transcript as &quot;our Harland&quot;).</p>
<p>New NPCs Met</p>
<p>• Alla: A High Elf attendant who greets the party upon their waking. He is described as having long white hair, wearing a gown with puffy sleeves, and notably wearing socks with sandals. He has a small bird chirping on the side of his head. He is polite but condescending regarding the players' &quot;mortal&quot; nature, shedding a single tear at the concept of them dying one day,.</p>
<p>• Joonad: A Halfling trader met at The Trident and Shell. He provided information on the state of the world but was ultimately the victim of a prank involving a magical illusion of a peacock,.</p>
<p>• Queen Carellan (Mentioned): Alla informs the group that they will be meeting Queen Carellan (likely a reference to Corellon Larethian) in two days at the War Council.</p>
<p>Area Descriptions</p>
<p>• The Bedroom: A beautiful room blending wooden architecture with marble streaks. It features &quot;living carpets&quot; made of grass, open windows with fresh mountain air, and four-poster beds.</p>
<p>• Ahalin (The City): The city is built upon five mountainous spires, thousands of feet in the air. It is divided into three rings:</p>
<p>◦ Inner Ring: Courtyards, fountains, and the central spire where the party stayed.</p>
<p>◦ Middle Ring: A metropolitan area three times the size of the inner ring, containing offices, schools, and homes that blend into the trees.</p>
<p>◦ Outer Ring: The &quot;lower&quot; district, though still more beautiful than any human slum.</p>
<p>◦ The entire city is protected by a shimmering dome projected by huge blue crystal shards. There are &quot;Sky Docks&quot; where flying ships are currently unloading cargo and passengers.</p>
<p>• The Trident and Shell: A pub located in the second ring. Unlike the rest of the city, it is rowdy, filled with non-elf traders, and serves as a &quot;home away from home&quot; for outsiders trusted by the elves,.</p>
<p>Key Facts &amp; Information Revealed</p>
<p>• The State of the World: While the party slept for two days, the Shadowfell influence spread. Medeis University, Duvia, Riverspire, and parts of Phandelver have fallen to the darkness. Bhurgarom and the Jorus (held by the Aldabras) remain safe for now,.</p>
<p>• The War Council: A council is convening in two days to decide how to fight back. Leaders from across Vlendir are being teleported or flown in via sky ships,.</p>
<p>• Duvia's Collapse: Joonad revealed that while he didn't see the &quot;mind control&quot; jewelry in Duvia, the region collapsed into chaos at the same time as the other attacks. The fall of Duvia was caused by political assassinations, backstabbing, and riots among the merchant houses.</p>
<p>• Current Status: The party retains their gear, including the Shadowfell Shard and the Astral Shard, which were found safe in their trunks.</p>
<p>Memorable Moments</p>
<p>• The Peacock Prank: In The Trident and Shell, the party grew tired of Joonad's high prices (4 gold per beer). Hiraani (or Graa) cast Silent Image to conjure a tiny, beautiful peacock in the Halfling's hand. While Joonad was terrified and distracted by the illusion, the party stole half their money back. Joonad fled the bar in confusion,,.</p>
<p>• Preparation: The group rented rooms across the street from the pub (20gp per night) and decided to spend the next day shopping for &quot;ostentatious&quot; clothing and studying maps and politics to ensure they are taken seriously at the upcoming War Council,.</p>
