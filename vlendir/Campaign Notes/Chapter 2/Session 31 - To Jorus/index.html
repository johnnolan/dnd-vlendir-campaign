    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>As the group finished reading the letter, they investigated around the cellar and finding themselves a few barrels of Grog that they hooked up for bar in the main house.</p>
<p>On their way out, Graa took a moment to memorise the symbol on the floor and they made their way upstairs.</p>
<p>Meeting Captain Lee and his crew who had now come ashore, they shared drinks and stories and had a good nights sleep after deciding the best way to the Jorus is West through the forest to the Jorus.</p>
<p>Just before bed, Captain Lee points out a smoking pipe on the fireplace. Upon closer inspection it appeared to me Dwarven in make. Hiraani took it for his own, and the group went out the back of the cabin to smoke and drink while the sunset. Upon smoking the pipe, Hiraani noticed that whatever he thought, as he blew smoke out, it formed the images he had in his mind.</p>
<p>As the morning came, they made their way back to the ship and the return journey back to Riverspire with Captain Lee.</p>
<p>Upon landing ashore, they said their farewells to Captain Lee and were immediately met by Saskia and Harry.</p>
<p>Saskia agreed to visit their house and place a warding spell over it to discourage others from accessing the teleportation circle and agreed to help them to the edge of the forest to aid their journey.</p>
<p>Harry, very upset, gave them all hugs, Doge gave him a big lick and ran off into the village with a last look back at Graa. Saskia shares with the group that the village have decided to form a council to run the town now and that she is looking forward to the future.</p>
<p>Taking the group to a huge tree on the edge of the village, Saskia takes them through the tree and out onto the very edge of the Jorus that peaked just through the treeline.</p>
<p>Making their way to the edge of the tree line, they investigated their surroundings and found no sign of life around.</p>
<p>They took their first step out into the Jorus.</p>
<p>Wanting to make their way to Autumnrun, they headed out over the wild grasslands with Hiraani in front leading them.</p>
<p>On their first night out on the Jorus, they heard and saw no movement as they awake the next morning.</p>
<p>Getting back on their horses, they thundered across the plain and later that day, as they crossed over a hill, they descended into a now familiar world of the Feywild. As they pull up, they notice in front of them a little creature covered in slime, sat on a log giggling to iteself, surrounded by beautiful flowers.</p>
<p>As they approach, it shouts out that it was waiting for them and that Aislaine has sent a present for them. But that is boring and first wants to play a game. They each have to pick a flower and bring it to him.</p>
<p>The group reluctantly agree, annoyed by this creature and as they pick a flower each, they each in turn transform into a Mimic that attacks them.</p>
<p>The group make swift work of the creatures, striking them down easily before turning back to the creature who is in hysterics.</p>
<p>As a portal opens behind him, he throws a bow towards the group and flicks a gold coin as a thank you, which Graa grabs out of the air, for playing before falling back into the portal and dissapearing.</p>
<p>Getting their bearings, they pick up the bow and see the edge of the Feywild bubble they are in. Moving towards it and out, they step out and notice a day has passed since they were in there.</p>
<p>Back on their hroses, they continue on for the day keeping an eye out around them.</p>
<p>As they went round the corner of a hill, they are met by a small contingent of armed soldiers, as the lead soldier steps forward and raises his hand for them to halt, Lorena immediately recognises these as her father Monty's soldiers.</p>
