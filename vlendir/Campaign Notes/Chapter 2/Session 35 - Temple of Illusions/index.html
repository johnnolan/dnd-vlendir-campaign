    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>As the group approached the stairs going down, they saw water falling down the inner side of the steps. Getting Doge to lead, he went down and indicated that the coast was clear.</p>
<p>As they went down the stairs, they entered into a chamber where to the left of them lay a old tent with a letter. GOing over and reading it, it said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cannot get through that fire. My sponsor is going to be furious if I don't explore these tunnels. There seems to be some sort of lever on the other side of the flames but I cannot get to it. I need to think. If it wasn't for that damn hissing all the time I could think properly! Cannot see a single snake but the sound has been going for days now! It looks as though these caverns connect underground right across the Jorus. Like they were build 1000s of years ago, long forgotten. It appears Dwarven and Human in build yet everything has been covered by a new type of architecture inside. Snake symbols are everywhere. Would not be funny if there were some sort of snake people under here. The noises are getting unbearable, I think I have a way through the flames, gotta try. Can't go back or they will have my head. Only way is forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making their way forward, the path opened up into an area empty except for a single lever on a wall. Just ahead they saw on the wall what appeared to be a broken face of a snake on the wall and behind it where it was built on top of, 2 faces of dwarves looking either way.</p>
<p>Using mage hand and stepping clear, they pulled on the lever. Suddenly giant fireballs smashed across the chamber missing them completely from their safe distance. As the scorch marks cooled on the walls, the lever dissapeared and then reappeared in its previous state.</p>
<p>Moving around the corner, they were now met with a hole in the ground, 10 feet across. After much discussion, they got doge to run and jump across. He landed safely and waited for a rope to be thrown. As they did, he grabbed the rope and went out of view. As the rope went taught, Lorena grabbed the other end and Graa attempted to walk across the rope.</p>
<p>As he made his way across, the rope began to wobble under his feet and he fell off plummeting down. As he prepared for the worst, he hit a solid floor where the hole should have been.</p>
<p>They realised this thing was an illusion and then walked freely and apprehensively across the hole.</p>
<p>Getting to the other side they saw old statues dragged and smashed everywhere of times past. Each representing humans and drwarves.</p>
<p>As they turned the corner to go to the northern point of the chamber, they heard the sounds of sobbing around the corner. They immediately recognised the voices as those of Saskia and Harry. Prepping to go around, Graa heard more snake creatures around the corner taunting them and counting down. As they reached 2, the group rounded the corner and ran to attack them. As they did, they saw the snake creatures run a blade across Saskia and Harry's neck and them drop to the floor dead. A couple of seconds later, still in shock and anger, the image of them dissapeared, another illusion.</p>
<p>A furious battle ensued as they found themselves trying to cope with mind tricks causing them to freeze or run away in fear. One spell cast covered Lorena and Graa in darkness, blinding them and creature within lashing out. Hiraani ran around the corner and dispelled it with ease. Fighting the effects off, they killed them all including a giant warrior snake and some sort of shaman.</p>
<p>Hurt and confused, after the battle they searched around for loot and found a Staff of Utility which Graa took and a Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals. Digging deeper they found one more item, a large pot of dried coconut...</p>
<p>As they looked around, they saw the door north of them which was made of two slabs of thick solid stone upon which had writting on in dwarvish a message.</p>
