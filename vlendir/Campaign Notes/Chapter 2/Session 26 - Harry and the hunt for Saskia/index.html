    <h1 class="article-page-heading">Session 26 - Harry and the hunt for Saskia</h1>
    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>Before making their way downstairs, Lorena attempted to commune in her room</p>
<ul>
<li>The elven druid, is she involved with the demons? - No</li>
<li>If we can find her, can we win her over to us? - Indifferent</li>
<li>The Mayor said she is surrounded by the magical barrier, is there anything special we need to do? - Indifferent</li>
</ul>
<p>As the party awoke and made their way downstairs, Ivan met them downstairs to a table full of breakfast and are welcomed by Ivan.</p>
<p>As they sat at the table, Hiraani communed in front of everyone</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the villagers under a curse? - No</li>
<li>The wolf creature? Is that part of the Fey? - No</li>
<li>The barrier, is that Fey magic like before? - Indifferent</li>
</ul>
<p>As he came to, Ivan stared strangely towards them and continued eating.</p>
<p>Thinking there may be more rifts around the area, the group discuss in front of Ivan about the possibilities of travelling between planes and what it means.</p>
<p>They asked for more information about Saskia, finding out she was over 800 years old and must have made a pact with the demons. Seeing the complete distrust in her, they pushed further and began to wonder whether he was actually telling the truth.</p>
<p>At that point, a young scruffy serving lad entered the room to take some plates away and tripped over Graa on his way out. Graa immediately grabbed the boy and putting his hand in the communal tod pot of justice, he got a hand full of Tod and smashes it in his face. To Graa's surprise he laughs at what happened, appologises and runs into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Ivan then excused himself and left to do work around town.</p>
<p>Leaving them alone, the group got in an argument about the treatment of the boy with Graa calling him simple, before the boy re-enetered the room telling them to &quot;Fuck off&quot; and toss a coin purse in the air proclaiming how much money he has. At that point Graa realised his coin purse was missing and in its place, a note.</p>
<p>Chucking the bag on the table he instantly goes to Graa in awe asking to touch his horns. As he reaches out, graa tries to block him but he finds his way through and grabs them anyway, laughing and jumping back.</p>
<p>After some pleasent and annoying banter (for Graa), he introduces himself as Harry and talks about his relationship with Saskia and how great she is. She had asked for the group to go to her when they could.</p>
<p>As the group made to leave, Hiraani didn't trust Ivan and decided to follow him around, putting on his hat of disguise. Eventually he found him talking to Barry and Chad, arguing about letting the adventurers help them.</p>
<p>Rejoining with the group, they made their way south towards Saskia with Doge and Harry who immediately fell in love and allowed Harry to get on his back.</p>
<p>On their way they ask Harry about Bebop and Rocksteady and they find out how they beat him and picked on him. After the conversation soon turned to how cool, strong and powerful Graa is as he began to warm to Harry.</p>
<p>Setting up camp Graa settled down to commune, to start the ritual he tricked Harry into sitting under an acorn tree before using a cantrip to shake the acrons on his head.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is Saskia known as a powerful druid? - Yes</li>
<li>Are we far from her? - No</li>
<li>Is this boy suited to be molded in our way of thinking - Oh yes!</li>
</ul>
<p>They all settled down with Harry camping down with Graa.</p>
<p>During the watch at night, high in the sky they saw a giant bird, high in the sky, then a peacful nights sleep.</p>
<p>Awakening, Lorena gives Harry the Ring of Mist to help him. Then setting off on the final part of the journey.</p>
<p>As they got further down the road, they reached a cross roads and in the distance, a cart overturned in the road. Harry, runs off to investigate for them. After he had gone for a while, they crept up too and met him coming back through the trees. Confirming their were bodies ripped apart and no one else there.</p>
<p>Recognising the wounds to be of a giant bird of some kind, Harry realises it is the result of an attack by a giant Griffin in the area, not usually known for hunting people. The looked up the trail to see where the blood went up the hillside out of sight.</p>
<p>Choosing not to go kill it, they continued to move off the path through the forest as Harry gets more excited as they get closer.</p>
<p>In front they are met with a shimmering barrer in front in the forest, Harry shoots off quickly on the back of Doge followed by Hiraani quickly behind and then Lorena and Graa.</p>
<p>The group stepped through into what seemed to be a mimicary of the Feye Wild, definitely not the same, almost a memory of what it once was.</p>
<p>Moving across a bridge in front of them, they see a huge bear that looks at Doge and bows gently with an enourmous respect. Then stepping behind they see a Old but beautiful 6 foot 7 figure dresses in a green robe approach. Harry immediately jumps off Doge and runs for a hug shouting Saskia! and telling her he brought them.</p>
<p>&quot;So, you have come to kill me have you?&quot; She says with a smile on her face. Then notices Doge and loses her composure muttering oh my to herself. Taking a knee and bowing to Doge, they then stare in silence at each other as if a conversation is happening without them noticing.</p>
<p>Asking them into her house and getting them unpacked and introducing themselves to each other. After conversation they discover that the major is in fact a Werewolf with the ability to bring to life these Hell Hounds.</p>
<p>Discovering about each of them being Feye touched and the fact they had visited he, she promised to go away and find out more for when they are back.</p>
<p>She gave them 4 vials of silver for their blades to ensure they can fight it and offers to transport them straight there.</p>
<p>Double checking that she is truthful, Lorena decided to commune</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we trust Saskia? - Yes</li>
<li>Is the werewolf Ivan? - Unsure</li>
<li>Can the Hell Hounds that were converted from villages be brought back? - Unsure</li>
</ul>
<p>The group discussed the potential of taming the Griffin they heard about and settled down for the night ahead of a day of a great battle.</p>
