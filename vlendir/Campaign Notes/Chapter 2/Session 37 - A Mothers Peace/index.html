    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>As the adventurers stood at the top of the 100ft stairs going down underground, they prepped ahead of their journey. Swapping weapons and preparing spells, the took a deep breath and made their way down into the tunnel.</p>
<p>As they reached the bottom, they saw the same layout of the tunnel ahead. Smooth, dark stone with 4 strips of lightly illuminated runes lighting up the way forward as dar as the eye can see. Taking the Sand Timer given to them by Ebras, they turned it to record their next few days underground.</p>
<p>As they took their first steps, they felt a moment of magic taking over their bodies and began moving with pace through the magical tunnel ahead.</p>
<p>As the day wore on, the monotonous repetition of these tunnels continued.</p>
<p>They got to mid afternoon before their ears pricked up and ahead of them could hear a muted sound of a pick axe hitting stone. Repeating a pattern of continously hitting a rock, they moved closer but quietly towards the sound.</p>
<p>As they did, a figure became clearer, a small humanoid using a Pick Axe repetitively hitting the same spot.</p>
<p>Shouting out to hail them, Lorena's voice was muted by the magic in the tunnels but nevertheless carried to the now visible Dwarf. There came no response from him as he continued.</p>
<p>Moving closer now, they studied this individual who paid them no attention. Looking for any kind of magic, they felt none in him. Reaching out to touch him, Lorena's hand goes straight through him and he dissapears.</p>
<p>A moment later, the same Dwarf appears behind them, walks past and picks up an axe to continue hitting the same spot.</p>
<p>This was a lost spirit of an age long past. They said a little praire and continued on listening as the sound of the pick axe left them behind.</p>
<p>As the final part of the day came to an end, they heard water ahead of them. A gentle &quot;Swooshing&quot; noise.</p>
<p>As they moved closer they saw in front of them 3 row boats and a barge tied up as the tunnel opened up wider to show a long stretch of water ahead of them. As they examined the water for any life, they found none except the slow moving and sparkling of the occasional plankton, lit up by the runes under water and above giving the tunnel a reflective beauty.</p>
<p>Making camp for the night, they prepared a meal and communed.</p>
<p>Hiraani decided to cook while Graa communed. While he communed, Hiraani decided to do a &quot;Tod Pot&quot; for him and try and convince him it is fine.</p>
<p>To call The Keeper, Graa threw a stick into the water, teasing Doge. As he did, Doge ran right up to the water and stopped. Looking back at Graa, he shook his head and wandered back to his sitting place and bowl of food.</p>
<ul>
<li>Question 1: Is the ghost they saw previous of any concern - No</li>
<li>Question 2: These boats, have the been used recently? - No</li>
<li>Question 3: Could we make it across this lake in one day? - Yes</li>
</ul>
<p>After the commune, noticing Graa looked upset, he attempted to quickly knock the tod out of his hand to prevent any anger. Seeing him do this, Graa realises and throws it to the floor. Looking closer he sees the Tod Medley and becomes somewhat angry.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Doge, nudges his bowl with his nose over to Graa to have, nods and walks back to lie down.</p>
<p>Awaking the next day, well rested, they see the same walls around them and decide to move on by taking the Barge across the water. Picking up two long poles, they take turns throughout the day to punt their way through the tunnel.</p>
<p>As they made their way, some better at driving the barge than others, they head down the long water way.</p>
<p>At midday, they hear just ahead a sound of clicking and clacking coming from ahead. Pulling the poles out of the water and riding the motion they had created, the creep closer to the sound. Looking up and ahead they see 2 creatures hanging from the roof of the tunnel. A mix of bird and sea creature they had huge beaks and crab like claws. Looking closer they realised they hadn't sensed their presence and decided to maybe try and sneak past. Hiraani as they were discussing attempted to see if they were alive or not, tried to throw a stick in the water below them however ended up tripping and mistiming his throw, only getting the stick to land a small distance in front of the boat.</p>
<p>They decided to try and sneak instead and as they did, Doge climbed to the back of the barge, got in the water and with his head resting on the barge, began to silently kick underwater, moving them silently past them while they held their breath.</p>
<p>Slowly creeping past, silent as a mouse, they gently make their way under the sleeping creatures, undisturbed.</p>
<p>Continuing to the end of the tunnel, they reach the opposite end of the water and pull up to a dock at the end. Getting out, they realise its the end of the day and make camp for the night. Before closing their eyes, bored, Lorena plays a game of I Spy before even that game has its limits within these walls.</p>
<p>Upon waking the next day, they pack up and once again make their way through the repetitive tunnel.</p>
<p>After a short while, just in front of them, they see a bright natural light ahead of them and a whiff of fresh air, the first time since they have been down here. Attempted to detect whether this is the Feywild, Hiraani decided it wasn't. Moving closer, they see where the walls around them stop as if exploded out opening into a bright and open area ahead. Readying their weapons they crept up closer.</p>
<p>Approaching the opening, their eyes adjusted and before them they saw a giant open cavern, circular in shape with a dome like raise in the middle. The dome covered in spiked rocks sticking up out of it. On the rock and around the outsides they could see plants, ferns and moss, birds flying within, fire flies and high up in the roof, 200ft high, breaks where sun struck down onto the rocky surface below.</p>
<p>Freezing, Hiraani reached out to detect any types of creatures while Lorena steps towards it slowly. Hiraani detects the essence of a creature ahead. Throwing a rock at Lorena to make her stop, he informs the others.</p>
<p>Treading more carefully now, Lorena looks at her trident feeling no sign of threat.</p>
<p>Stepping into the cave entrance, they see two figures stood waiting in front of them. 2 Tortles, dressed in cloth robes and hair pieces staring with giant grins on their faces. As they walk towards to the adventurers, they introduce themselves warmly and invite the group to sit with them. Uldon and Lila they named themselves.</p>
<p>They walked to the center of the room, at the highest peak of the dome under them and sat. Just beside them to saw a magical spell moving constantly, torches lit around the room and little shacks and tents covered the ground around them. They poured everyone a cut of tea as they talked about how they have lived here for 250 years and it has just been the two of them.</p>
<p>The area used to be part of a old trade tunnel and their job is to ensure that the orb glowing in the center remains. Magic around the area appears to keep evil out so they have never had to fight to keep this area secure. They asked about themselves, what brings them here as the first people they have seen in over 250 years.</p>
<p>Informing them they are on their way to Aldabra using the tunnels. Going to rescue Lorena's father who is a Lord there. Hearing Lorena is of the Aldabra's, the two immediately took note and questioned further with a Grin on their face noticing the Trident on her back.</p>
<p>Explaining that evil is creeping into the world, dragons, werewolves and now they are to fight an Incubus and Succubus who have taken Aldabra. They hadn't heard about anything this evil since the great rebalancing. About 1500 years ago, the realms were one and chaos reigned. Split, the planes were put into order having the Shadowrealm and the Feywild sit alongside the Material plane. Everything that was left of these creatures was wiped out leaving only traces of their existance while they thrived in their own. Peace reined and magic slowly faded.</p>
<p>Lorena asked whether it was relevant that her mother had found a Dragon Turtle that had taken a liking to her. Lila's face drops her tea in shock and grabs onto Uldon in shock. Turning to Lorena she asks for more details.</p>
<p>Explaining that it is still alive and growing fast, they both burst into joy. Suddenly everyone felt a rumble under their feet and the orb in the middle of the room flicker violently before going out. Standing up immediately they heard beneath them a giant intake of breath as the ground shuddered. Realising what they were on, a giant and old Dragon Turtle.</p>
<p>Lila quickly said come with us and they made their way quickly to the north of the cave. As they bent down on the back of its shell towards the front, Lila explained that the turtle they found is the offspring of this Dragon Turtle. For 900 years she has been kept care of, sustaining her so that she may see one of her offspring live to carry her species on, the last of her kind. Over the years each egg has either failed to hatch or never lived past a day. We had almost given up hope.</p>
<p>This news, she must have heard it. She is fading now. The magic has been the only thing allowing her to breath since she has been stuck here... I think she is ready for her peace now, now she knows one of her children has made it. Its time to let her go.</p>
<p>As the group fell silent, they watched and waited for the next hour as the time between each breath got longer... and longer... until finally, there were no more breaths.</p>
