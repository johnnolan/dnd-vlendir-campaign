    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>The group attack the Marid in its lair destroying it and finally releasing the final part of the puzzle of Hiraani's darkness.</p>
<p>As they land the killing blow, the group notice a stream of light connecting the Marid to the crystal dissapears. With that, a giant, multicoloured Dragon gets released from the crystal shard as the shard drops to the floor empty.</p>
<p>The Dragon raises its wings, stretching out, balancing on its hing lends before landing on all four to immediately stare at the three adventureres.</p>
<p>After a failed Wisdom saving throw, its face smiles at them all...</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you all for freeing me, and what are the chances it would be three as yourselves...&quot;</p>
<p>It looks at the crystal and stretches one more time and looks back to them.</p>
<p>&quot;Graa, how is your master, it has been a long time since I have seen him.&quot; - Graa not happy with Crispin being referred to as his master, replies politely that he is doing okay. &quot;Crispin, such a strange word he chose. I know him as Magnus. Magnus who... the last time I met those who are similar was 2000 years ago when I was trapped in this crystal, by choice of course. Magnus, Jeb and a woman called Jennifar asked me to go into this crystal and use my life energy so they could complete a ritual with a machine that would allow the leylines to rejoin again, or at least become stable to prevent Asmodeus from bringing his armies through as well as the Feywild and Shadowfell collapsing in one another. Magnus, Jeb and Jennifar with the Elves from Ahalin were the ones that built this device, placed me in this crystal and I thought everything was safe. But it looks like they have all been emptied and I am free again. But this can only mean that, well I looked into your memories and the plains are collapsing again? I guess it brought some peace in that time.&quot;</p>
<p>Hiraani asks if they can do it again.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know, I was just a sacrifice at the time. Speak to the Elves or Magnus, you must tell him, he does not know?&quot; They tell about a broken Astral shard but have a Shadowfell shard with a demon in. They now have an empty Feywild Shard.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I have done my time, I am going back to the Feywild&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Key note: The group found a note in the ship, the shipping manifest mentioned Hiraani's parents were to drop people off in Wintermaw and wait 14 days to pick up what cargo they returned with and sail back to Duvia. But the Marid knew this at the time, struck a deal with Hiraani to get involved with sinking the ship. Once sunk it took the crystal here to absorb the magic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lorena asks and finds out that in order to fill the shard again to make it work, it would need to be filled with a significant Feywild energy and have strong enough arcane skills to do so. If they can get to the Feywild and trap a creature then they could make it work. They would need to speak to Magnus and the High Elves in Alvarin.</p>
<p>Magnus appears to be at least 2000 years old, he still looks the same as back then.</p>
<p>TODO: Insert further questions from Lorena.</p>
<p>The Dragon says goodbye, bows and takes flight before turning invisible and through the exit.</p>
