    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>As the Dragon flies from the cave, Hiraani is knocked unconcious by a Rock falling from the ceiling. The group carry him back to the sunken ship, collect his parents dead bodies and go back to the ship.</p>
<p>Hiraani soon wakes an finds out his friends. They decide to</p>
<ul>
<li>Send Ardor and ship to the lighthouse to preserve Hiraani's parents bodies for a burial when things are dealt with.</li>
<li>Also drop a message to Big Al in Bhurgarom saying &quot;Await our return. Fill up the skulls butter beer, the trio are returning.&quot;</li>
<li>Struck a deal where they invested 600 gold for Ardor to invest in his trips up the coast lines to try and make some money.</li>
</ul>
<p>Graa then used his teleport spell to bamf them to Medeis island. They were met by Fallint who they immediately questioned on &quot;What do you know about Magnus!?!&quot;. Looking confused, he suggested they rest for the evening in Graa's appartment on campus and meet him with Crispin in the morning.</p>
<p>The group got a long rest in Graa's appartment, but during the night, Graa felt compelled to retrieve his stolen book from his crotch pocket and place it closer to him.</p>
<p>The next morning, the 3 of them went through the crowds of busy students on the campus towards Crispins house. Lorena, charging in, went straight to his desk and slammed the picture of the device they found at the bottom of the ocean demanding &quot;Explain this!&quot;.</p>
<p>Crispin changed his worried and focussed face to a kindly smile and welcomed them all, asking them to sit. &quot;It is great to see you all, we have a lot to talk about&quot;.</p>
