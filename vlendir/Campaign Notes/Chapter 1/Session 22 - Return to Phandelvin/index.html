    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>As they stand there in shock under a full moon and Phandelvin burning, they decide to quickly drop the dragon wings on the floor and mount the horses to get to the town as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>As the 3 of them and Doge charge forward, Doge senses something and alerts Hiraani to it. As they all look about they can see something big running through the trees keeping pace with them.</p>
<p>They pull up sharply and then out of the tree line springs 2 disrupter beasts. Combat ensues and they are soon taken care of.</p>
<p>Getting back onto the horses for the small final part of the run, they burst through the front entrance seeing fire all around them.</p>
<p>As they step through the entrance, they see a bunch of people healing behind a barricade and among them a figure shouting out orders. 5 foot 10, skinny as a rake, pale with deep bags under his eyes, panting heavily. Bloodied with a sword in his hand while ordering people to bandage and heal, he shouts up at them all. &quot;Here! Its me, Harbin, the townmaster, quick!&quot;. Among them is big Al who is alive but badly hurt. Lieing in front of them are 2 of the same beasts slain.</p>
<p>After a quick healing hand from Hiraani on Big Al, he shouts for them to get to the town square and help falcon and elva, they have things under control here.</p>
<p>As they run into the town, they are met with a figure standing in the middle of the town near the shrine watching everything happen. Standing at 6 foot 6, this beautiful female figure with long grey hair and eyes with pale white skin, stands in front of them with 2 Displacer Beasts, lit by the burning fires of the houses.</p>
<p>She is facing towards the inn where a temporary barricade is up with Falcon and Elva are there making a last stand.</p>
<p>As they stand there watching, she turns her attention to them and hints that it was herself who had been controlling the dragon.</p>
<p>Seeing an opportunity, Elva runs screaming at her with the spear that Lorena Aldabra gave her, As the woman turns, she casts a spell, freezing Elva in place as well as Falcon..</p>
<p>She walks over to Elva and makes a ssh emotion. She commands her to place one end of the spear in the ground then slowly walk into the spike as the point goes through her slowly killing her.</p>
<p>As she looks up, she says &quot;Time to go&quot; and then dissapears along with all her 2 displacer beasts.</p>
<p>The adventurers ran over to Elva to see if she still lived. Seeing no sign of life, Falcon came running over now, no longer affected by the spell cast.</p>
<p>Falcon explained they split the group, the main group at the entrance and Falcon and Elva as a last line against the injured and fraile at the inn.</p>
<p>As they talked, the group they saw at the entrance now approach, catching up. Seeing the scene in front of them, they fall silent, some dropping to their knees. Harbin asks if its over, Hiraani reassures him it is.</p>
<p>As the begin the clean up, Big Al approaches and takes Elva's body up to an inn in the room and Hiraani went in to begin healing all that he can around the room.</p>
<p>Lorena Aldabra and Graa S'oua moved around the village and using magic, managed to extinguish the houses still on fire.</p>
<p>Making their way back to the inn Lorena Aldabra asked Hiraani to cast cure wounds on Falcon as she gives him an awkward smile.</p>
<p>Just before bed, Hiraani sends a message to the Orcs warning them of the evil woman they found to which they replied &quot;Good. Bring her on!&quot;</p>
<p>They all saw themselves exhausted to sleep in the main room of the inn alongside the others.</p>
<p>Come the morning, they rise and walk over to the entrance of the inn seeing Harbin standing there. As thanks he offers them the deed to a house called Hunters Lodge south of Phandelvin.</p>
<p>Big Al then joins them overhearing their reward and tells them of his plan to take Elva back to her home in <strong>Bhurgarom</strong> and spend some time there with the Dwarves.</p>
<p>As they accept his offer, they look up to see and hear 3 horses walking through the town towards them. All draped in long robes covering what looked like pure white armour with gold and red trim beneath it.</p>
<p>The lead figure with a concerned look suddenly makes eye contact with Graa S'oua and jumping off his horse to run up and clasp him on his shoulder, greets Graa S'oua saying &quot;Well met, Graa! Sorry, my name is Crispin&quot;</p>
