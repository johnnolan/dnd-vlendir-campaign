    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>As the adventurers looked on in horror at 3 Ogres running towards them, tired and covered in blood, they faced their enemies and carried on with renewed strength and determination.</p>
<p>As Lorena Aldabra swung between the 2 orcs surrounding her, Hiraani joined in and finished one off with his rapier before running back to take cover to shoot with his bow.</p>
<p>Graa S'oua attempted to shoot acid at one passing Ogre but missed drawing its attention his way. As the Ogre ran at him to take a swipe, he threw up his magical shield after being whispered too by The Keeper saving his life. Stepping back he launched a Poison Spray burning the Orc to pieces before Lorena Aldabra finished him off with her blade.</p>
<p>As Lorena Aldabra found herself surrounded, she dispatched with another Ogre before catching both an Orc and Ogre running past her, slicing them across the arse with a fierce blow causing them to pause their chase towards Hiraani .</p>
<p>As they all dispatched the final Ogre, they took a breath to look at the 12 Orcs and 3 Ogres they have slain. Upon searching the dead Hiraani found a Belt of Hill Giant Strength. As he attuned to the belt, Lorena Aldabra and Graa S'oua made their way into the temple to investigate.</p>
<p>They saw the golden bell they had been talking about and after Graa S'oua used Mage Hand to ring the bell, they decided to leave it be.</p>
<p>As they approached the furtherest room, they found an alter which appeared upon inspection to be on rollers of some kind. With Hiraani joining them, he decided to push against it successfully moving the alter back revealing a chest containing 2 Moon Rapiers and a Robe of the Magi.</p>
<p>However as soon as Hiraani pushed on the alter, his body went limp and his spirit flew from his body flying through the air to see at the top of a mountain, a castle where upon the top, sleeping in the howling wind, the dragon. As the dragon stired and stared up with a small grin on its face, he was thrust back and into his body.</p>
<p>After Hiraani explained his vision, he got into an argument with Graa S'oua on who should have what loot before finally coming to an agreement.</p>
<p>Not wanting to upset any gods, the adventurers decided to leave the gold bell where it was.</p>
<p>The group decided the report back to Don Jon on what they found. As they approached him, whittling a piece of wood outside the entrance, they described what Hiraani saw and he confirmed that it sounded like the Dragon was at Icespire Hold.</p>
<p>After reporting to Don Jon and him informing that himself and the other miners would be on their way back in a few days, the adventures walked back to Phandelver arriving around 2200 to windows dimmed with black curtains and the only noise coming from the Inn. Also noticing, in the center of the town, a familiar Gnome made Crossbow Platform armed and ready. The Gnomes made good on their promise.</p>
<p>Making their way to the door ready to enter.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>DM Learnings</p>
<p>When Graa tried to pick pocket my first reaction was shock and trying to prevent it. That isn't my choice, its the players and I should of been more flexible for this to happen. I set the seen, the story is the players.</p>
