    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>After they had slane the boar the adventurers continued to search the 3 caverns around them</p>
<p>Searching each they found 2 Lamps, 4 Oil Flasks and 6 torches and 2 Tinderbox as well as a +1 shield and a Potion of Invulnerability.</p>
<p>On one of the Acholites they found a Ring of Mist.</p>
<p>They then made their way from the Circle of Thunder, back to Falcons Lodge.</p>
<p>Upon approaching the Lodge they were ambushed by 2 Giant White Wolves and a female troll. The troll appeared to have a male head hanging from her belt and was able to command the wolves.</p>
<p>As they fought, Falcon emerged from the Lodge to aid them and between them all they managed to take down the enemies.</p>
<p>Upon investigation they realised this must have been the partner to the Troll they had previously killed in Mountain Toe Gold Mine.</p>
<p>Falcon signalled to them to come rest in his lodge where he ate and chatted with the group before going back out to clear the corpses and to rest.</p>
<h3>Rewards Granted</h3>
