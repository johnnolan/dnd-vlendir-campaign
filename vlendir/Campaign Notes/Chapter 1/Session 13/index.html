    <h2>General Summary</h2>
<p>As the adventurers approached the entrance of the Stonehill Inn, they opened the door to be greated by a warm interior and a inn full of their past friends all huddled around a table, Ulla (f) Pog (m), Linene Graywind, Elmar Barthen, Dazlyn Grayshard and Norbus Ironrune. Sat by the bar nursing a beer was Big Al and over alone on another table sat Elva Gwennip.</p>
<p>Getting a few whiskys and a milk from the barkeep, the adventurers made their way towards the crowded table, pulled up some chairs and started conversaion.</p>
<p>Learning about the group all working together now to fortify the town and some history about Lorena Aldabra Uncle who ran away with an Orc he fell in love with, they discussed whether they could strike up a deal with the Orcs. Talking with the people at the table they liked the idea but worried the other townsfolk wouldn't take to this idea and that in other place in the world this may be an easier thing to talk about. They encouraged Lorena Aldabra to keep being proud of her Uncle doing such a thing.</p>
<p>Linene also brought up about Adabra Gwynn visiting recently and taking a few new helpers with her to keep producing potions. She left the group a Greater Healing Potion, should they return.</p>
<p>They called over Elva Gwennip and she reluctantly but drunkenly made her way over to the table. Upon getting there she told everyone of her reasons to be there hating herself for being so pitiful. Lorena Aldabra then gave her her spear to hold on to so she could use it and have confidence in herself.</p>
<p>Big Al, made his way to the table after the adventurers had talked about their missions and the vision of the dragon. He suggested they make an attempt at fetching a sword that lied under a hill that covers an old Ancient Dragons bones. Here there is rumour of a sword that could be useful in the fight ahead.</p>
<p>He also mentions about gaining the help of a person called Falcon who could aid them in their defense of the town with his years of hunting skills and being a veteran.</p>
<p>The adventurers then took a nights rest and awoke to decide to make their way to Falcon for help. As they were getting a coffee for breakfast, Lorena Aldabra tried to sneak a bit of whisky for it but was caught. The barkeep just smiled and poored some in for her.</p>
<p>Upon reaching Falcon's Hunting Lodge, they rang a bell outside and were met by Falcon himself. After questioning them for their names and recognising them as the group he had heard about, he invited them in to his home and offered his cloak to Lorena Aldabra who somewhat sheepily and struck by this figure of a man, accepted and followed him into his kitchen.</p>
<p>They talked about the Dragon Barrow and the entity that lived within. Falcon agreed to try and read up on what this entity may be but it would take him a while. In the mean time he asks them to attempt to clear a suspected base just up the road, 2 hours away. It was putting too much pressure on him alone and the 3 of them would make easy work of it and allow him more time to protect the borders.</p>
<p>They agreed and Lorena Aldabra got to keep his cloak as a gift for their travel in the gathering snow. She accepted very sheepily blushing her way out of his Lodge.</p>
<p>As they approached the Manse, Hiraani snuck up into the house and quietly made his way through to find a Courtyard with vine snaking out of a well. As he approached and peered over the edge, he noticed staring up at him 4 vine like creatures that began to slowly make their way out of the hole.</p>
<p>After fighting these things back they noticed 7 orcs also come charging through the courtyard, alerted by the noise. After getting hacked by some brutal axe swings, they managed to dispatch quite a few of them, before out of nowhere an unknown enemy approached through the courtyard and let off a Lightening bolt, killing the vine in front of it and hitting Lorena Aldabra with a brutal blow.</p>
<p>As the adventurers moved back, for the first time worried that they may be over powered and be killed, Lorena Aldabra and Hiraani managed to get a few swift attacks in with their blades, taking out this entity just as it was charing up another spell of Lightening heading their way.</p>
<p>Exhausted and tired, they fell back into the turret to get their breath and take a short rest.</p>
